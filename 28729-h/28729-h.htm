<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">t</span> is hardly necessary to observe that, after the able and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
account of the proceedings and result of the British
Embassy to the court of China, by the late Sir George Staunton
(who was no less amiable for liberality of sentiment, than
remarkable for vigour of intellect) it would be an idle, and,
indeed, a superfluous undertaking, in any other person who ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>companied
the embassy, to dwell on those subjects which have
been treated by him in so masterly a manner; or to recapitulate
those incidents and transactions, which he has detailed
with equal elegance and accuracy.</p>

<p>But, as it will readily occur to every one, there are still many
interesting subjects, on which Sir George, from the nature of
his work, could only barely touch, and others that did not
come within his plan, one great object of which was to unfold
the views of the embassy, and to shew that every thing,
which could be done, was done, for promoting the interests of
the British nation, and supporting the dignity of the British
character; the Author of the present work has ventured,
though with extreme diffidence, and with the consciousness of
the disadvantage under which he must appear after that "Account
of the Embassy," to lay before the public the point
of view in which <i>he</i> saw the Chinese empire, and the Chinese
character. In doing this, the same facts will sometimes necessarily
occur, that have already been published, for reasons that
it would be needless to mention; but whenever that happens
to be the case, they will briefly be repeated, for the purpose of
illustrating some position, or for deducing some general inference.
Thus, for instance, the document given to the Embassador
of the population of China will be noticed, not however
under the colour of its being an unquestionably accurate statement,
but, on the contrary, to shew that it neither is, nor can
be, correct; yet at the same time to endeavour to prove, by
facts and analogy, that, contrary to the received opinion, the
country is capable of supporting not only three hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
thirty-three millions of people, but that it might actually afford
the means of subsistence to twice that number. The confirmation,
indeed, of new and important facts, though very different
conclusions be drawn from them, cannot be entirely
unacceptable to the reader; for as different persons will generally
see the same things in different points of view, so, perhaps,
by combining and comparing the different descriptions and
colouring that may be given of the same objects, the public is
enabled to obtain the most correct notions of such matters as
can be learned only from the report of travellers.</p>

<p>With regard to China, if we except the work of Sir George
Staunton, and the limited account of Mr. Bell of Antermony,
which was not written by himself, it may be considered as
unbeaten ground by Britons. We have heard a great deal of
Chinese knavery practised at Canton, but, except in the two
works abovementioned, we have not yet heard the sentiments
of an Englishman at all acquainted with the manners, customs,
and character of the Chinese nation. The voluminous communications
of the missionaries are by no means satisfactory; and
some of their defects will be noticed and accounted for in the
course of this work; the chief aim of which will be to shew
this extraordinary people in their proper colours, not as their
own moral maxims would represent them, but as they really
are&mdash;to divest the court of the tinsel and the tawdry varnish
with which, like the palaces of the Emperor, the missionaries
have found it expedient to cover it in their writings; and to
endeavour to draw such a sketch of the manners, the state of
society, the language, literature and fine arts, the sciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and civil institutions, the religious worship and opinions, the
population and progress of agriculture, the civil and moral character
of the people, as may enable the reader to settle, in his
own mind, <i>the point of rank which China may be considered to
hold in the scale of civilized nations</i>.</p>

<p>The stability of the Chinese government; the few changes
that have been made in its civil institutions for such a number
of ages; the vast extent of empire and immense population,
forming one society, guided by the same laws, and governed by
the will of a single individual, offer, as Sir George Staunton has
observed, "the grandest collective object that can be presented
for human contemplation or research." The customs, habits
and manners, the wants and resources, the language, sentiments
and religious notions, of "the most ancient society and the most
populous empire existing amongst men," are, without doubt
most interesting subjects for the investigation of the philosopher,
and not unworthy the attention of the statesman. But
the expectations of the man of science, the artist, or the naturalist,
might perhaps be rather disappointed, than their curiosity
be gratified, in travelling through this extensive country. It
can boast of few works of art, few remains of ancient grandeur.
The great wall, that for a time defended its peaceable
inhabitants against the attacks of the roving Tartars, the walls
of its numerous cities, with their square towers and lofty
gates, and here and there an old pagoda, are its only architectural
antiquities; and, when these are excepted, there is not
perhaps a single building in the whole extent of China that has
withstood the action of three centuries. There are no ancient
palaces nor other public edifices, no paintings nor pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sculpture, to arrest the attention of the traveller, unless it might
be from the novelty of their appearance. In travelling over the
continent of Europe, and more especially on the classic ground
of Italy and Greece, every city, mountain, river, and ruin, are
rendered interesting by something on record which concerns
them; the theme of some poet, the feat of some philosopher or
lawgiver, the scene of some memorable action, they all inspire
us with the liveliest sensations, by reviving in the mind those
pleasures which the study of their history afforded in early life.
To Europeans the history of China has hitherto furnished no
materials for such recurrence, and the country itself is therefore
incapable of communicating such impressions. In vain should
we here look for the massy and stupendous fabrics that appear
in the pyramids and the pillars of the ancient Egyptians; the
beautiful and symmetrical works of art displayed in the temples of
the Greeks; the grand and magnificent remains of Roman
architecture; or that combination of convenience and elegance
of design which characterize the modern buildings of Europe.
In China every city is nearly the same: a quadrangular space of
ground is enclosed with walls of stone, of brick, or of earth, all
built upon the same plan; the houses within them of the same
construction; and the streets, except the principal ones that run
from gate to gate, invariably narrow. The temples are, nearly,
all alike, of the same awkward design as the dwelling-houses, but
on a larger scale; and the objects that are known in Europe by
the name of pagodas, are of the same inelegant kind of architecture,
from one extremity of the empire to the other, differing
only in the number of rounds or stories, and in the materials of
which they are constructed. The manners, the dress, the amusements
of the people, are nearly the same. Even the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
country, as far as regards the fifteen ancient provinces, is subject
to little variation, and especially those parts over which the
grand inland navigation is carried; the only parts, in fact, that
foreigners travelling in China have any chance of visiting.</p>

<p>In this route no very great variety nor number of subjects
occur in the department of natural history. Few native plants,
and still fewer wild animals, are to be expected in those parts of
a country that are populous and well cultivated. Indeed the
rapid manner in which the present journey was made, was ill
suited for collecting and examining specimens even of those few
that did occur.</p>

<p>On these considerations it is hoped that the indulgence of
the reader will not be withheld, where information on such
points may appear to be defective. A French critic<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (perhaps
without doing him injustice he may be called a hypercritic) who
happened to visit Canton for a few months, some fifty years
ago, has, with that happy confidence peculiar to his nation, not
only pointed out the errors and defects of the information communicated
to the world by the English and the Dutch embassies,
but has laid down a syllabus of the subjects they ought to have
made themselves completely acquainted with, which, instead of
seven months, would seem to require a residence of seven years in
the country. But the author of the present work rests his confidence
in the English critics being less unreasonable in their demands;
and that their indulgences will be proportioned to the
difficulties that occurred in collecting accurate information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>With this reliance, the descriptions, observations, and comparisons,
such as they are, he presents to the public, candidly acknowledging
that he is actuated rather by the hope of meeting its
forbearance, than by the confidence of deserving its approbation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may not be thought amiss, before he enters on the
more immediate subject of the work, to correct, in this place, a
very mistaken notion that prevailed on the return of the embassy,
which was, that an unconditional compliance of Lord Macartney
with all the humiliating ceremonies which the Chinese might
have thought proper to exact from him, would have been productive
of results more favourable to the views of the embassy.
Assertions of such a general nature are more easily made than
refuted, and indeed unworthy of attention; but a letter of a
French missionary at Pekin to the chief of the Dutch factory
at Canton is deserving of some notice, because it specifies the
reasons to which, according to the writer's opinion, was owing
the supposed failure of the British embassy. In speaking of
this subject he observes, "Never was an embassy deserving of
better success! whether it be considered on account of the
experience, the wisdom, and the amiable qualities of Lord
Macartney and Sir George Staunton; or of the talents, the
knowledge, and the circumspect behaviour of the gentlemen
who composed their Suite; or of the valuable and curious
presents intended for the Emperor&mdash;and yet, strange to tell,
never was there an embassy that succeeded so ill!</p>

<p>"You may be curious, perhaps, to know the reason of an
event so unfavourable and so extraordinary. I will tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in a few words. These gentlemen, like all strangers, who
know China only from books, were ignorant of the manner
of proceeding, of the customs and the etiquette of this court;
and, to add to their misfortune, they brought with them a
Chinese interpreter still less informed than themselves. The
consequence of all which was that, in the first place, they
came without any presents for the Minister of State, or for
the sons of the Emperor. Secondly, they refused to go
through the usual ceremony of saluting the Emperor, without
offering any satisfactory reason for such refusal. Thirdly,
They presented themselves in clothes that were too plain,
and too common. Fourthly, They did not use the precaution
to fee (graisser la patte) the several persons appointed to the
superintendance of their affairs. Fifthly, Their demands
were not made in the tone and style of the country. Another
reason of their bad success, and, in my mind, the principal
one, was owing to the intrigues of a certain missionary,
who, imagining that this embassy might be injurious to the
interests of his own country, did not fail to excite unfavourable
impressions against the English nation."</p>

<p>The points of failure enumerated in this letter of Monsieur
Grammont, were so many spurs to the Dutch factory to try
their success at the court of Pekin the following year. No
sooner did Mr. Van Braam receive this dispatch, by the return
of the English embassy to Canton, than he prepared a letter
for the Commissaries General at Batavia, in which he informed
them, that as it was the intention of the different nations who
had factories established in Canton, to send embassadors to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Capital, for the purpose of congratulating the Emperor on his
attaining the age of eighty-four years, which would be in the
sixtieth year of his reign, he had resolved to proceed on such
a mission on the part of the Batavian Republic, and requested
that he might be furnished, without delay, with suitable credentials.
To this application the Commissaries General, who
had been sent out the same year to retrench the expences of
the Company in their Indian settlements, and to reform abuses,
returned for answer, That, "however low and inadequate their
finances might be to admit of extraordinary expences, yet
they deemed it expedient not to shew any backwardness in
adopting similar measures to those pursued by other Europeans
trading to China; and that they had, accordingly,
nominated Mr. Titsingh as chief, and himself (Mr. Van
Braam) as second Embassador to the Court of China."</p>

<p>Mr. Titsingh lost no time in repairing to Canton, and these
two Embassadors, determining to avail themselves of the hints
thrown out in Monsieur Grammont's letter, and thereby to
avoid splitting on the same rock which, they took for granted,
the British Embassador had done, cheerfully submitted to every
humiliating ceremony required from them by the Chinese, who,
in return, treated them in the most contemptuous and indignant
manner. At Canton they were ordered to assist in a solemn
procession of Mandarines to a temple in the neighbourhood, and
there, before the Emperor's name, painted on cloth, and suspended
above the altar, to bow their heads nine times to the
ground, in token of gratitude for his great condescension in
permitting them to proceed to his presence, in order to offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him tribute. They submitted even to the demands of the state-officers
of Canton, that the letter, written by the Commissaries
General at Batavia to the Emperor of China, and translated
there into the Chinese language, should be broke open,
and the contents read by them; and that they should further
be allowed to make therein such alterations and additions as
they might think proper. The Embassador, resolving not to
be wanting in any point of civility, requested to know when
he might have the honour of paying his respects to the Viceroy;
and received for answer, that the customs of the country did
not allow a person in his situation to come within the walls
of the Viceroy's palace, but that one of his officers should receive
his visit at the gate; which visit <i>to the gate</i> was literally
made. Mr. Van Braam, in relating this circumstance in his
journal, observes, that the Viceroy "assured his Excellency, he
ought not to take his refusal amiss, as the same terms had
been prescribed to Lord Macartney the preceding year."
Mr. Van Braam knew very well that Lord Macartney never
subjected himself to any such refusal; and he knew too, that
the same Viceroy accompanied his Lordship in a great part
of his journey from the Capital: that he partook of a repast,
on the invitation of Lord Macartney, at the British factory;
when, for the first time, both Mr. Van Braam and the supercargoes
of all the European nations had been permitted to sit
down in the presence of one of his rank.</p>

<p>At Pekin they were required to humiliate themselves at least
thirty different times, at each of which they were obliged, on
their knees, to knock their heads nine times against the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which Mr. Van Braam, in his journal, very coolly calls, performing
the salute of honour, "<i>faire le salut d'honneur</i>."
And they were finally dismissed, with a few paltry pieces of
silk, without having once been allowed to open their lips on
any kind of business; and without being permitted to see either
their friend Grammont, or any other European missionary,
except one, who had special leave to make them a visit of half
an hour, the day before their departure, in presence of ten or
twelve officers of government. On their arrival in this Capital
they were lodged, literally, in a stable; under the same cover,
and in the same apartment, with a parcel of cart-horses. Mr.
Van Braam's own words are, "<i>Nous voilà donc à notre arrivée
dans la célèbre residence impériale, logés dans une espèce d'écurie.
Nous serions nous attendus à une pareille avanture!</i>"</p>

<p>After such a vile reception and degrading treatment of the
Dutch Embassy, what advantages can reasonably be expected
to accrue from a servile and unconditional compliance with the
submissions required by this haughty government? It would
rather seem that their exactions are proportioned to the complying
temper of the persons with whom they have to treat.
For it appears, not only from Mr. Van Braam's own account
of the Embassy, but also from two manuscript journals in the
Author's possession, one kept by a Dutch gentleman in the
suite, and the other by a native Chinese, that the Embassadors
from the Batavian Republic were fully prepared to obviate
every difficulty that might arise from the supposed points of
failure in the British Embassy, as directed to their notice
by M. Grammont. In the first place, they not only carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
presents for the Ministers of State, but they calmly suffered
these gentlemen to trick them out of the only curious and valuable
articles among the presents intended for the Emperor, and
to substitute others, of a mean and common nature, in their
place. Secondly, they not only complied with going through
the usual ceremony of saluting the Emperor, but also of saluting
the Emperor's name, painted on a piece of silk, at least fifty
times, on their journey to and from the Capital: which degrading
ceremony they even condescended to perform before
the person of the Prime Minister. With regard to the third
point, it certainly appears that no expence had been spared in
providing themselves with splendid robes for the occasion; but,
unfortunately, they had but few opportunities of making use
of them, their baggage not arriving at the Capital till many
days after they had been there. Nor does it seem that the
dress of a foreign Embassador is considered of much consequence
in the eyes of the Chinese; for, when these gentlemen
wished to excuse themselves from going to court, on account
of their dusty and tattered clothes, in which they had performed
a most painful journey, the Master of the Ceremonies
observed, that it was not their <i>dress</i>, but their <i>persons</i>, which
the Emperor, his master, was desirous to see. And, it can
hardly be supposed, they would omit observing the fourth
article, which, Mr. Grammont is of opinion, was neglected by
Lord Macartney. And, in the last place, they stand fully
acquitted of any want of <i>humility</i> in the tone and style of their
communications, after having allowed their credentials to be
new modelled by the officers of Government at Canton; from
which city they had also an interpreter, a very proper one, no
doubt, appointed to attend them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Their mission, it is true, was not well calculated for making
terms or rejecting proposals. The Chinese were not unacquainted
with the declining finances of the Dutch; they knew
very well that the embassy had originated in Canton, and that it
was accredited only from their superiors in Batavia. In their
journey they were harassed beyond measure; sometimes they
were lodged in wretched hovels, without furniture and without
cover; sometimes they were obliged to pass the night in the
open air, when the temperature was below the freezing point;
frequently for four and twenty hours they had nothing to eat.
Van Braam observes that, owing to the fatigues of the journey,
the badness of the victuals, their early rising and exposure to
the cold, he lost about five inches in the circumference of his
body. Being rather corpulent, and not very expert in performing
the Chinese ceremony at their public introduction, his hat
happened to fall on the ground, upon which the old Emperor
began to laugh. "Thus," says he, "I received a mark of distinction
and predilection, such as never Embassador was honoured
with before. I confess," continues he, "that the recollection
of my sufferings from the cold in waiting so long in the
morning, was very much softened by this incident." No man
will certainly envy this gentleman's happy turn of mind, in
receiving so much satisfaction in being laughed at.</p>

<p>The tone of the Emperor's letter, with which they were dismissed,
while it speaks the vain and arrogant sentiments of this
haughty government, shews at the same time how well acquainted
they were with the circumstances that gave rise to the
mission, and the degree of estimation in which they held it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was written in the Tartar, Chinese, and Latin languages, from
the last of which, as rendered by the missionaries, the following
is a literal translation. The contents were addressed to the
Council of India, but on the outside wrapper, "<i>To the King of
Holland</i>." It may serve at the same time as a specimen of
Chinese composition.</p>

<p>"I have received from heaven the sceptre of this vast empire.
I have reigned for sixty years with glory and happiness; and
have established the most profound peace upon the four
seas<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the said empire, to the benefit of the nations bordering
upon them. The fame of my majesty and proofs of
my magnificence have found their way into every part of the
world, and they constitute the pride and the pleasure of my
vast domains.</p>

<p>"I consider my own happy empire, and other kingdoms,
as one and the same family; the princes and the people are,
in my eye, the same men. I condescend to shed my blessings
over all, strangers as well as natives; and there is no country,
however distant, that has not received instances of my benevolence.
Thus, all nations send to do me homage, and to
congratulate me incessantly. New and successive Embassadors
arrive, some drawn in chariots over land, and others traverse,
in their ships, the immensity of the seas. In fact, I attend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>to nothing but the good administration of my empire. I feel
a lively joy in observing the anxiety with which they flock
together from every quarter to contemplate and admire the
wise administration of my government. I experience the
most agreeable satisfaction in participating my happiness
with foreign states. I applaud therefore your government,
which, although separated from mine by an immense ocean,
has not failed to send me congratulatory letters, accompanied
with tributary offerings.</p>

<p>"Having perused your letters, I observe that they contain
nothing but what I consider as authentic testimonies of your
great veneration for me, from whence I conclude that you
admire my mode of governing. In fact, you have great
reason to applaud me. Since you have carried on
your trade at Canton, (and it is now many years,) strangers
have always been well treated in my empire; and they have
individually been the objects of my love and affection. I
might call to witness the Portuguese, the Italians, the English,
and others of the same sort of nations, who are all equally
esteemed by me, and have all presented me with precious
gifts. All have been treated, on my part, after the
same manner, and without any partiality. I give abundantly
even when those things I received from them are of no
value. My manner of doing these things is undoubtedly
known in your country.</p>

<p>"Concerning your Embassador, he is not, properly speaking,
sent by his King; but you, who are a company of merchants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
have supposed yourselves authorized to pay me this respect.
Your Sovereign, however, having directed you to chuse a favourable
moment of my reign, you have now sent to felicitate me
accordingly in the name of your said Sovereign. The sixtieth
year of my reign was about to be completed. You, a company,
too distant from your Sovereign, could not announce it
to him. Interpreting this to be his pleasure, you have undertaken
to send, in his name, to do me homage; and I have no
doubt this prince is inspired towards me with the same sentiments
which I have experienced in you. I have, therefore,
received your Embassador as if he had been sent immediately
by his King. And I am desirous you should be made acquainted
that I have remarked nothing in the person of your
Embassador, but what bore testimony of his respect for me,
and of his own good conduct.</p>

<p>"I commanded my great officers to introduce him to my
presence. I gave him several entertainments, and permitted
him to see the grounds and the palaces that are within my vast
and magnificent gardens of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>. I have so acted
that he might feel the effects of my attention, dividing with
him the pleasures which the profound peace of my empire
allows me to enjoy. I have, moreover, made valuable presents,
not only to him, but also to the officers, interpreters,
soldiers, and servants of his suite, giving them, besides what
is customary, many other articles, as may be seen by the
catalogue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Embassador being about to return to the presence of
his sovereign, I have directed him to present to this Prince
pieces of silk and other valuable articles to which I have
added some antique vases.</p>

<p>"May your King receive my present. May he govern his
people with wisdom; and give his sole attention to this grand
object, acting always with an upright and sincere heart:
and, lastly, may he always cherish the recollection of my
beneficence! May this King attentively watch over the affairs
of his kingdom. I recommend it to him strongly and earnestly.</p>

<p>"The twenty-fourth day of the first moon of the sixtieth
year of the reign of Kien Long."</p>

<p>The very different treatment which the English embassy received
at the court of Pekin is easily explained. The Chinese are well
informed of the superiority of the English over all other nations
by sea; of the great extent of their commerce; of their vast
possessions in India which they have long regarded with a jealous
eye; and of the character and independent spirit of the
nation. They perceived, in the manly and open conduct of
Lord Macartney, the representative of a sovereign in no way inferior
to the Emperor of China, and they felt the propriety,
though they were unwilling to avow it, of exacting only the
same token of respect from him towards their sovereign, that one
of their own countrymen, of equal rank, should pay to the portrait
of his Britannic majesty. It must, however, have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hard struggle between personal pride, and national importance,
before they resolved to reject so fair a proposal, and consent to
wave a ceremony which had never, on any former occasion,
been dispensed with. It is easy to conceive how strong an impression
the refusal of an individual to comply with the ceremonies
of the country was likely to make on the minds of the
Emperor and his court; how much they must have suffered in
their own opinion, and how greatly must their pride have been
mortified, to find that by no trick, nor artifice, nor stretch of power,
could they prevail on an English Embassador to forego the dignity
and respect due to the situation he held at their court, whither
they were now convinced he had not come, as was signified
in painted letters on the colours of the ships that transported the
embassy up the <i>Pei-ho</i>, "<i>to offer tribute to the Emperor of
China</i>."</p>

<p>With regard to the intrigues of the Portugueze missionary,
mentioned in Mr. Grammont's letter, Lord Macartney was sufficiently
aware of them long before his arrival in the capital, and
took such measures, in consequence of the information, as were
most likely to be effectual in counteracting any influence that
he might secretly exert, injurious to the interests of the British
nation. But the intrigues of churchmen are not always easily
obviated, especially where they are suspicious of their errors being
exposed or their ignorance detected. It is a painful truth (and
is noticed here with reluctance, on account of the many worthy
members of the society) that the ministers of a certain branch of
a religion whose distinguishing feature is meekness and forbearance,
should have so far perverted the intention of its benevo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>lent
author, as to have produced more intrigues, cabals, and
persecutions, than even the relentless Mahomedans, whose first
article of faith inculcates merit in destroying those of a different
persuasion. Their political intrigues and interference in state
affairs, have done material injury to the cause of Christianity in
almost every country into which their missions have extended.</p>

<p>The malignant spirit of this same Portugueze missionary was
not confined to the framing of falsehoods and misrepresentations
with regard to the views of the British embassy, but has continued
to exert its influence at the court of Pekin, in the same
secret and dishonourable way, whenever an opportunity occurred
that seemed favourable for raising unwarrantable suspicions
in the minds of the Chinese against the English nation.
Towards the close of the last war, when it was found expedient
to take possession of some of the Portugueze colonies, and an
expedition for this purpose was actually sent out to secure the
peninsula of Macao, this missionary lost no time in suggesting
to the Chinese court, that the designs of the English in getting
possession of Macao might be of the same nature as those they
had already practised in India; and that if they were once suffered
to get footing in the country, China might experience
the same fate as Hindostan. Fortunately for the concerns of
the British East India Company this officious interference and
the malevolent insinuations of <i>Bernardo Almeyda</i> took a very
different turn to what he had expected. The intelligence of a
hostile force so near the coast of China coming first from an
European missionary, implied a neglect in the Viceroy of Canton,
and an angry letter was addressed to him from court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ordering him to give immediate and accurate information on
the subject. The Viceroy, nettled at the officious zeal of the
Portugueze, positively denied the fact of any hostile intention
of the English, "who, being a brave people, and terrible in
arms, had intimidated the Portugueze at Macao, though
without reason, as their ships of war, as usual, came only to
protect their ships of commerce against their enemies." When
this dispatch of the Viceroy reached Pekin, the Emperor was
so exasperated to think that the Court had suffered itself to be
misled by an European missionary, that he ordered Almeyda to
appear before the master of the household, and on his knees
to ask forgiveness of <a name="a" id="a"></a>a crime, which, he was told, deserved to be
punished with death; and he was dismissed with a caution never
more to interfere in the state affairs of China. The whole of this
curious transaction is published in the Pekin Gazette of last
year; so that the English have gained a considerable degree of
reputation by it, so much, indeed, that the Chinese at Canton
(and a great deal depends upon their representations) would
have no objection to see the English in possession of Macao;
for they cordially hate, I believe it is not too much to say
they despise, the Portugueze, and they speak with horror of
the French. What a moment then is this for England to turn
to its advantage!</p>

<p>Independent, however, of the machinations of missionaries,
such is the pride and the haughty insolence of the Chinese
government, that, in no instance on record, but that of the
British embassy, has it ever relaxed from its long established
customs, nor acquiesced in any demands of foreign embassadors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whether the tone in which they were made was supplicating or
authoritative. The forms of the court they contend to be as
immutable as were the laws of the Medes and Persians. Every
thing must be conducted by prescriptive usage, and no deviation
allowed from the rules which for ages have been established
by law, and registered by the council of ordinances; much
less the remission of any duty that might derogate from the
reverence and respect which are considered to be due to the person
of the Emperor.</p>

<p>It may be imagined, then, that an event so new as a refusal
to submit to the degrading ceremony required from an embassador,
at his public introduction, could not fail of making a
very strong impression on the minds of those about the person
of his Imperial Majesty; who, as Mr. Van Braam says, were
(and without doubt they were) much better satisfied with the
complying temper of the Dutch, than with the inflexible pertinacity
of the English. Yet, they did not venture to lodge the latter
in a stable, nor think proper to persevere in demanding unreasonable
homage. Neither was any pique or ill-nature apparent
in any single instance, after the departure of the embassy from
the capital, but very much the contrary. The officers appointed
to conduct it to Canton testified the most earnest
desire to please, by a ready attention to every minute circumstance
that might add to the comforts of the travellers, or alleviate,
if not entirely remove, any little inconvenience. It was
a flattering circumstance to the embassador to observe their
anxiety for the favourable opinion of a nation they had now
begun to think more highly of, and of whom, in measuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with themselves, it was not difficult to perceive, they felt,
though too cautious to avow, the superiority.</p>

<p>The British embassy was a measure which it was absolutely
necessary to adopt, for reasons that are stated at full length in
the first chapter of Sir George Staunton's valuable work, and
the foundation it has laid for future advantages more than
counterbalances the trifling expence it occasioned to the East
India Company, which did not exceed two per cent. on the
annual amount of their trade from England to Canton. Those
who had formed immoderate expectations must have little understood
the laws and customs of China, which admit not the
system of mutual intercourse between distant nations, by means
of embassadors or resident ministers at the respective courts.
Their custom is to receive embassadors with respect and hospitality;
to consider them as visitors to the Emperor, and to
entertain them accordingly as his particular guests, from the
moment they enter the country till they return to the boundaries
of his empire. This being necessarily attended with an
enormous expence<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, the court of ceremonies has prescribed
forty days for the residence of foreign embassadors, either in
the capital, or wherever the court may happen to be; though on
particular occasions, or by accident, the term may sometimes
be extended to double that time.</p>

<p>Thus by consulting the accounts of the different European
embassies that have been sent to China in the two last centu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ries,
it will be found that the residence of none of them was
extended to <a name="thrice" id="thrice"></a>thrice the term fixed by the court of ceremonies,
and two of them did not remain the period allowed.</p>

<p>The first embassy sent by the Dutch arrived in Pekin
the 17th July 1656, and departed the 16th October following,
having remained ninety-one days.</p>

<p>The second Dutch embassy arrived in Pekin the 20th June
1667, and departed the 5th August, having resided forty-six
days.</p>

<p>The first Russian embassy arrived at the capital on the 5th
November 1692, and left it on the 17th February 1693, having
remained there one hundred and six days.</p>

<p>The second Russian embassy arrived at Pekin on the 18th
November 1720, and did not leave it till the 2d March 1721,
being one hundred and fourteen days.</p>

<p>These two embassies were immediately connected with the
commercial concerns of the two nations, which were then
transacted in the capital of China, but now confined to the
adjoining frontiers.</p>

<p>The Pope's embassy arrived in Pekin on the 15th December
1720, and departed the 24th March 1721, being ninety-nine
days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The Portugueze embassy entered Pekin the 1st May 1753,
and left it the 8th June following, being only thirty-nine days.</p>

<p>The British embassy arrived in Pekin the 21st August 1793,
and departed the 7th October, being forty-seven days.</p>

<p>The third Dutch embassy entered the capital the 10th
January 1795, and left it the 15th February, being thirty-six
days.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it may be concluded, that neither Monsieur
Grammont, nor they who conceived that an unconditional
and servile compliance, on the part of the British Embassador,
would have been productive of more favourable results, were
right in their conjectures. On the contrary, it may, perhaps,
be rather laid down as a certain consequence, that a tone of
submission, and a tame and passive obedience to the degrading
demands of this haughty court, serve only to feed its pride, and
add to the absurd notions of its own vast importance.</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">f</span> any man should make a collection of all the inventions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and all the productions, that every nation, which now is,
or ever has been, upon the face of the globe, the whole
would fall far short, either as to number or quality, of what
is to be met with in China." These, or something similar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
are the words of the learned Isaac Vossius.</p>

<p>The testimony given by the celebrated authors of the <i>Encyclopédie
des Connoissances humaines</i> is almost equally strong:
"The Chinese who, by common consent, are superior to all
the Asiatic nations, in antiquity, in genius, in the progress
of the sciences, in wisdom, in government, and in true philosophy;
may, moreover, in the opinion of some authors,
enter the lists, on all these points, with the most enlightened
nations of Europe."</p>

<p>How flattering, then, and gratifying must it have been to
the feelings of those few favoured persons, who had the good
fortune to be admitted into the suite of the British Embassador,
then preparing to proceed to the court of that Sovereign who
held the government of such an extraordinary nation; how
greatly must they have enjoyed the prospect of experiencing,
in their own persons, all that was virtuous, and powerful, and
grand, and magnificent, concentrated in one point&mdash;in the city
of Pekin!</p>

<p>And if any doubts might have arisen, on consideration that neither
the learned Canon of Windsor, nor the celebrated Authors
of the Encyclopédie, were ever in China; that the first was wonderfully
given to the marvellous, and the latter had no other
authorities, than those of the Jesuits, and other missionaries for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
propagating the Christian faith, yet such doubts were more
inclined to yield to the favourable side, as being supported by
the almost unanimous concurrence of a multitude of testimonies,
contained in the relations that have, at various times, been published
not only by the missionaries, but also by some other travellers.</p>

<p>The late Sir William Jones, indeed, who deservedly took
the lead in oriental literature, had observed, in speaking of the
Chinese, that "By some they have been extolled as the oldest
and wisest, as the most learned, and most ingenious, of nations;
whilst others have derided their pretensions to antiquity,
condemned their government as abominable, and
arraigned their manners as inhuman; without allowing
them an element of science, or a single art, for which
they have not been indebted to some more ancient and more
civilized race of men."</p>

<p>It is true, also, the researches of Mr. Pauw, the sagacious
philosopher of Berlin, and the narrative of the elegant and
impressive writer of Lord Anson's Voyage, convey to the
reader's mind no very favourable ideas of the Chinese character;
yet, as the enquiries of the one were entered upon in a
spirit of controversy, and directed to one single point, and the
author, as justly has been observed of him, delights sometimes to
take a swim against the stream, many deductions were clearly to
be made from the conclusions of Mr. Pauw. And with regard
to the Narrative of Mr. Robins, it may be remarked that, to
decide upon the general character of the Chinese, from the
dealings Lord Anson had with them in the port of Canton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would be as unfair, as it would be thought presumptuous in a
foreigner to draw the character of our own nation from a
casual visit to Falmouth, Killybeggs, or Aberdeen. The same
remark will apply to the accounts given of this nation by
Toreen, Osbeck, Sonnerat, and some others, who have visited
Canton in trading ships, none of whom were five hundred
yards beyond the limits of the European factories.</p>

<p>It would also have been highly illiberal to suppose, that a
body of men, remarkable, as the early Jesuit missionaries were
thought to be, for probity, talent, and disinterestedness, should
studiously sit down to compose fabrications for the mere purpose
of deceiving the world. Even Voltaire, who had little
partiality for the sacerdotal character, is willing to admit, that
their relations ought to be considered as the productions of the
most intelligent travellers that have extended and embellished
the fields of Science and Philosophy. This remark, with proper
allowances being made for the age in which they were
written, may perhaps be applied to the narratives of the early
missions to China, though not exactly to some others of a more
modern date. All the praises bestowed by the former on this
nation, the latter, it would seem, have, injudiciously, considered
themselves bound to justify; without taking into account the
progressive improvements of Europe within the last century
and a half.</p>

<p>That China was civilized to a certain degree before most of
the nations of Europe, not even Greece excepted, is a fact that
will not admit of a doubt; but that it has continued to im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>prove,
so as still to vie with many of the present European
states, as the missionaries would have it supposed, is not by any
means so clear. From the middle to the end of the sixteenth
century, compared with Europe in general, it had greatly the
superiority, if not in science, at least in arts and manufactures,
in the conveniences and the luxuries of life. The Chinese
were, at that period, pretty much in the same state in which
they still are; and in which they are likely to continue. When
the first Europeans visited China, they were astonished to find
an universal toleration of religious opinions; to observe <i>Lamas</i>
and <i>Tao-tzes</i>, <i>Jews</i>, <i>Persees</i>, and <i>Mahomedans</i>, living quietly
together, and each following his own creed without molestation;
whilst most of the countries in Europe were, at that time, torn
in pieces by religious schisms; and man was labouring with
enthusiastic fury to destroy his fellow-creatures, in honour of
his Creator, for a slight difference of opinion in matters of no
real importance, or even for a different acceptation of a word.
In China, every one was allowed to think as he pleased, and to
chuse his own religion. The horrid massacre of the Protestants
in Paris had terrified all Europe. China knew nothing of internal
commotions, but such as were sometimes occasioned by
a partial scarcity of grain. The art of improving vegetables
by particular modes of culture, was just beginning to be known
in Europe. All China, at that time, was comparatively a garden.
When the King of France introduced the luxury of silk
stockings, which, about eighteen years afterwards, was adopted
by Elizabeth of England, the peasantry of the middle provinces
of China were clothed in silks from head to foot. At this
period, few or none of the little elegancies or conveniences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
life were known in Europe; the ladies' toilet had few essences
to gratify the sense of smell, or to beautify, for a time, the
complexion; the scissars, needles, pen-knives, and other little
appendages, were then unknown; and rude and ill-polished
skewers usurped the place of pins. In China, the ladies had
their needlework, their paint-boxes, their trinkets of ivory, of
silver in fillagree, of mother-pearl, and of tortoise-shell. Even
the calendar, at this time so defective in Europe, that Pope
Gregory was urged to the bold undertaking of leaping over, or
annihilating, ten days, was found to be, in China, a national
concern, and the particular care of government. Decimal
arithmetic, a new and useful discovery of the seventeenth century
in Europe, was the only system of arithmetic in use in
China. In a word, when the nobility of England were sleeping
on straw, a peasant of China had his mat and his pillow;
and the man in office enjoyed his silken mattress. One cannot,
therefore, be surprized if the impressions made upon these
holy men were powerfully felt, or if their descriptions should
seem to incline a little towards the marvellous. Nor may perhaps
their relations be found to be much embellished, on a fair
comparison of the state of China with that of Europe in general,
from the year 1560 to the close of the same century.</p>

<p>These religious men, however, might have had their motives
for setting this wonderful people in the fairest point of view.
The more powerful and magnificent, the more learned and
refined they represented this nation to be, the greater would
be their triumph in the event of their effecting a change of the
national faith. It may also have occurred to them, that com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>mon
prudence required they should speak favourably, at least,
of a nation under whose power and protection they had voluntarily
placed themselves for life. There is every reason to suppose,
that in general they mean to tell the truth, but by suppressing
some part of it, or by telling it in such a manner as if they
expected it would one day get back to China in the language of
that country, their accounts often appear to be contradictory in
themselves. In the same breath that they extol the wonderful
strength of filial piety, they speak of the common practices of
exposing infants; the strict morality and ceremonious conduct
of the people are followed by a list of the most gross debaucheries;
the virtues and the philosophy of the learned are explained
by their ignorance and their vices; if in one page they
speak of the excessive fertility of the country, and the amazing
extension of agriculture, in the next, thousands are seen perishing
by want; and whilst they extol with admiration the progress
they have made in the arts and sciences, they plainly inform
us that without the aid of foreigners they can neither cast
a cannon, nor calculate an eclipse.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, however, the British embassy left England
under a favourable impression of the people it was about to visit.
Whether the expectations of all those who composed it, independent
of any political consideration, were realized, or ended
in disappointment, may partly be collected from the following
pages. The opinions they contain are drawn from such incidents
and anecdotes as occurred in the course of an eight months'
visit and from such as seemed best calculated to illustrate the
condition of the people, the national character, and the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the government. A short residence in the imperial palace of
Yuen-min-yuen, a greater share of liberty than is usually permitted
to strangers in this country, with the assistance of some
little knowledge of the language, afforded me the means of collecting
the facts and observations which I now lay before the
public; and in the relation of which I have endeavoured to adhere
to that excellent rule of our immortal poet,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
&mdash;&mdash;"Nothing extenuate,<br />
Nor set down aught in malice."<br />
</div></div>

<p>And as the qualities of good and evil, excellence and mediocrity,
in any nation, can only be fairly estimated by a comparison with
those of the same kind in others, wherever a similitude or a contrast
in the Chinese character or customs with those of any other
people ancient or modern occurred to my recollection, I have
considered it as not wholly uninteresting to note the relation or
disagreement.</p>

<p>The dispatches from China, received by the British Embassador
on his arrival at Batavia, communicated the agreeable intelligence
that his Imperial Majesty had been pleased, by a public
edict, not only to declare his entire satisfaction with the intended
embassy, but that he had likewise issued strict orders to the commanding
officers of the several ports along the coast of the Yellow
Sea, to be particularly careful that Pilots should be ready,
at a moment's notice, to conduct the English squadron to <i>Tien-sing</i>,
the nearest port to the capital, or to any other which
might be considered as more convenient and suitable for the
British ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>By this communication a point of some difficulty was now considered
to be removed. It was deemed a desirable circumstance
to be furnished with the means of proceeding directly to Pekin
through the Yellow Sea, and thus to avoid any intercourse with the
port of Canton; as it was well known the principal officers of the
government there were prepared to throw every obstacle in the
way of the embassy, and if not effectually to prevent, at least to
counteract, any representations that might be made at the imperial
court, with regard to the abuses that exist in the administration
of the public affairs at that place, and more especially to the
exactions and impositions to which the commercial establishments
are liable of the different nations whose subjects have established
factories in this southern emporium of China. It could
not be supposed, indeed, that their endeavours would be less exerted,
in this particular instance, than on all former occasions of
a similar nature.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Yellow Sea, as yet entirely unknown
to any European nation, was considered as a subject of some
importance, from the information it would afford the means of
supplying, and which, on any future occasion, might not only
lessen the dangers of an unknown passage, but prevent also much
delay by superseding the necessity of running into different ports
in search of Chinese Pilots, whom, by experience, we afterwards
found to be more dangerous than useful.</p>

<p>We passed through the streight of Formosa without seeing
any part of the main land of China, or of the island from
whence the streight derives its name, except a high point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
towards the northern extremity. The weather, indeed, during
three successive days, the 25th, 26th, and 27th July was so
dark and gloomy, that the eye could scarcely discern the largest
objects at the distance of a mile, yet the thermometer was from
80° to 83° the greater part of these days. A heavy and almost incessant
fall of rain was accompanied with violent squalls of wind,
and frequent bursts of thunder and flashes of lightning; which,
with the cross and confused swell in the sea, made the passage not
only uncomfortably irksome, but also extremely dangerous, on
account of the many islands interspersed in almost every part
of the strait.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th the sun set in a bank of fog,
which made the whole western side of the horizon look
like a blaze of fire, and the barometer was observed to have
fallen near one third of an inch, which, in these latitudes
and at sea, is considered as a certain indication of a change of
weather. There were on board some Chinese fishermen who
had been driven out to sea in one of the East India company's
ships, which we met with in the straits of Sunda. These men
assured us that the appearance of the heavens prognosticated one
of those tremendous gales of wind which are well known to
Europeans by the name of <i>Ty-phoon</i> and which some ingenious
and learned men have supposed to be the same as the Typhon
of the Egyptians or <ins title="typhôn">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#969;&#957;</ins> of the Greeks. The Chinese, however
have made use of no mythological allusion in naming this
hurricane. They call it <i>Ta-fung</i> which literally signifies
<i>a great wind</i>. The wind was certainly high the whole of the
night and the following day, the thunder and lightning dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ful,
and the variable squalls and rain frequent and heavy; the
depth of the sea from 25 to 30 fathoms.</p>

<p>The charts, however, of this passage into the Yellow Sea,
constructed by Europeans when the Chinese permitted foreign
nations to trade to <i>Chu-san</i>, are considered as sufficiently exact
for skilful navigators to avoid the dangerous rocks and islands.
By the help of these charts our squadron ventured to stand
through the still more intricate and narrow passages of the Chu-san
Archipelago, where, in the contracted space of about eight
hundred square leagues, the surface of the sea is studded with a
cluster, consisting, nearly, of four hundred distinct islands.</p>

<p>These islands appeared to us, in sailing among them, to be
mostly uninhabited, extremely barren of trees or shrubs, and
many of them destitute even of herbage, or verdure of any kind.
In some of the creeks we perceived a number of boats and other
small craft, at the upper ends of which were villages composed
of mean looking huts, the dwellings most probably of fishermen,
as there was no appearance of cultivated ground near them to
furnish their inhabitants with the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>The squadron having dropped anchor, we landed on one of
the largest of these islands; and walked a very considerable distance
before we saw a human being. At length, in descending a
valley, in the bottom of which was a small village, we fell in
with a young peasant, whom with some difficulty, by means of
an interpreter, we engaged in conversation. Embarrassed in thus
suddenly meeting with strangers, so different from his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
countrymen, in dress, in features, and complexion, his timidity
might almost be said to assume the appearance of terror. He soon,
however, gained confidence, and became communicative. He
assured us that the island on which we were, and of which he was a
native, was the best in the whole groupe, and the most populous,
except that of <i>Chu-san</i>; the number of its inhabitants being ten
thousand souls. It was discovered, however, before we had
been long in the country, that when a Chinese made use of the
monosyllable <i>van</i>, which in his language signifies ten thousand,
he was not to be understood as speaking of a determinate or
precise number, but only as making use of a term that implied
amplification. A state criminal, for example, is generally condemned
to undergo the punishment of being cut into <i>ten thousand</i>
pieces; the great wall of China is called the <i>van-lee-tchin</i>,
or wall of <i>ten thousand lee</i>, or three thousand English miles, a
length just double to that which the most authentic accounts
have given of it. But when he means to inform any one that
the emperor has <i>ten thousand</i> large vessels, for the purpose of
collecting taxes paid in kind, on the grand canal, instead of the
monosyllable <i>van</i> he invariably makes use of the expression nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine, as conveying a fixed
and definite number, and, in this case, he will be understood
to signify literally ten thousand. In this manner, I suppose,
we were to understand the population of the island <i>Lo-ang</i>.</p>

<p>At the sight of our large ships, so different in their appearance
from any of those belonging to the Chinese, a vast
number of boats, issuing from every creek and cove, presently
crowded together, in such a manner, and with so little manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>ment,
as to render it difficult to pass through without danger
of oversetting or sinking some of them; a danger, however,
to which they seemed quite insensible. Vessels of a larger
description, and various in the shape of their hulls and rigging,
from twenty tons burden and upwards, to about two hundred
tons, were observed in considerable numbers, sailing along the
coast of the continent, laden generally with small timber,
which was piled to such a height upon their decks, that no
extraordinary force of wind would seem to be required to
overturn them. Beams of wood, and other pieces that were
too long to be received upon the deck of a single ship, were
laid across the decks of two vessels lashed together. We saw
at least a hundred couple thus laden in one fleet, keeping close
in with the coast, in order to be ready, in case of bad weather,
to put into the nearest port, being ill calculated to resist a storm
at sea. The ships indeed that are destined for longer voyages
appear, from their singular construction, to be very unfit to
contend with the tempestuous seas of China. The general
form of the hull, or body of the ship, above water, is that of
the moon when about four days old. The bow, or forepart, is
not rounded as in ships of Europe, but is a square flat surface,
the same as the stern; without any projecting piece of wood,
usually known by the name of cutwater, and without any keel.
On each side of the bow a large circular eye is painted, in imitation,
I suppose, of that of a fish. The two ends of the ship
rise to a prodigious height above the deck. Some carry two,
some three, and others four masts. Each of these consists of
a single piece of wood, and consequently not capable of being
occasionally reduced in length, as those of European ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The diameter of the mainmast of one of the larger kind of
Chinese vessels, such as trade to Batavia, is not less than that of
an English man of war of sixty-four guns. And it is fixed
in a bed of massive timber laid across the deck. On each
mast is a single sail of matting, made from the fibres of
the bamboo, and stretched by means of poles of that reed,
running across, at the distance of about two feet from each other.
These sails are frequently made to furl and unfurl like a fan.
When well hoisted up and braced almost fore and aft, or
parallel with the sides of the ship, a Chinese vessel will sail
within three and a half, or four points of the wind; but they
lose all this advantage over ships of Europe by their drifting to
leeward, in consequence of the round and clumsy shape of
the bottom, and their want of keel. The rudder is so placed,
in a large opening of the stern, that it can occasionally be
taken up, which is generally done on approaching sands and
shallows.</p>

<p>The Chinese, in fact, are equally unskilled in naval architecture,
as in the art of navigation. They keep no reckoning
at sea, nor possess the least idea of drawing imaginary lines
upon the surface of the globe, by the help of which the position
of any particular spot may be assigned; in other words,
they have no means whatsoever of ascertaining the latitude or
the longitude of any place, either by estimation from the distance
sailed, or by observation of the heavenly bodies, with instruments
for that purpose. Yet they pretend to say, that many
of their early navigators made long voyages, in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
were guided by charts of the route, sometimes drawn on paper,
and sometimes on the convex surface of large gourds or
pumpkins. From this circumstance, some of the Jesuits have
inferred, that such charts must have been more correct than
those on flat surfaces. If, indeed, the portion of the convex
surface, employed for the purpose, was the segment of a sphere,
and occupied a space having a comparative relation to that
part of the surface of the earth sailed over, the inference might
be allowable; but this would be to suppose a degree of knowledge
to which, it does not appear, the Chinese had at any time
attained, it being among them, in every period of their history,
an universally received opinion, that the earth is a square, and
that the kingdom of China is placed in the very center of its
flat surface.</p>

<p>The present system of Chinese navigation is to keep as near
the shore as possible; and never to lose sight of land, unless
in voyages that absolutely require it; such as to Japan, Batavia,
and Cochin-China. Knowing the bearing, or direction of the
port intended to be made, let the wind be fair or foul, they
endeavour, as nearly as possible, to keep the head of the ship
always pointing towards the port by means of the compass.
This instrument, as used in China, has every appearance of
originality. The natives know nothing, from history or tradition,
of its first introduction or discovery; and the use of the
magnet, for indicating the poles of the earth, can be traced,
from their records, to a period of time when the greatest part
of Europe was in a state of barbarism. It has been conjectured,
indeed, that the use of the magnetic needle, in Europe, was
first brought from China by the famous traveller <a name="Marco" id="Marco"></a>Marco Polo
the Venetian. Its appearance immediately after his death, or,
according to some, while he was yet living, but at all events, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his own country, renders such a conjecture extremely probable.
The embassies in which he was employed by Kublai-Khan, and
the long voyages he performed by sea, could scarcely have been
practicable without the aid of the compass. Be this as it may, the
Chinese were, without doubt, well acquainted with this instrument
long before the thirteenth century. It is recorded in their
best authenticated annals merely as a fact, and not as any extraordinary
circumstance, that the Emperor <i>Chung-ko</i> presented
an embassador of Cochin-China, who had lost his way in coming
by sea, with a <i>Ting-nan-tchin</i> "a needle pointing out the south,"
the name which it still retains. Even this idea of the seat of
magnetic influence, together with the construction of the compass-box,
the division of the card into eight principal points, and
each of these again subdivided into three, the manner of suspending
the needle, and its diminutive size, seldom exceeding
in length three quarters of an inch, are all of them strong
presumptions of its being an original, and not a borrowed
invention.</p>

<p>By some, indeed, it has been conjectured, that the Scythians,
in the northern regions of Asia, were acquainted with the
polarity of the magnet, in ages antecedent to all history, and that
the virtue of this fossil was intended to be meant by the flying
arrow, presented to Abaris by Apollo, about the time of the
Trojan war, with the help of which he could transport himself
wherever he pleased. The abundance of iron ores, and
perhaps of native iron, in every part of Tartary, and the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
early period of time in which the natives were acquainted with
the process of smelting these ores, render the idea not improbable,
of the northern nations of Europe, and Asia, (or the Scythians,)
being first acquainted with the polarity of the magnet.</p>

<p>Yet even with the assistance of the compass, it is
surprizing how the clumsy and ill-constructed vessels of the
Chinese can perform so long and dangerous a voyage as that to
Batavia. For, besides being thrown out of their course by
every contrary wind, their whole construction, and particularly
the vast height of their upper works above the water, seems
little adapted to oppose those violent tempests that prevail on
the China seas, known, as we have already observed, by the
name of <i>Ta-fung</i>. These hurricanes sometimes blow with
such strength that, according to the assertion of an experienced
and intelligent commander of one of the East India Company's
ships, "Were it possible to blow ten thousand trumpets, and
beat as many drums, on the forecastle of an Indiaman, in the
height of a <i>Ta-fung</i>, neither the sound of the one nor the
other would be heard by a person on the quarter-deck of the
same ship." In fact, vast numbers of Chinese vessels are
lost in these heavy gales of wind; and ten or twelve thousand
subjects from the port of Canton alone are reckoned to perish
annually by shipwreck.</p>

<p>When a ship leaves this port on a foreign voyage, it is considered
as an equal chance that she will never return; and when
the event proves favourable, a general rejoicing takes place
among the friends of all those who had embarked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hazardous enterprize. Some of these ships are not less than a
thousand tons burden, and contain half that number of souls,
besides the passengers that leave their country, in the hope of
making their fortunes in Batavia and Manilla. A ship is seldom
the concern of one man. Sometimes forty or fifty, or
even a hundred different merchants purchase a vessel, and
divide her into as many compartments as there are partners,
so that each knows his own particular place in the ship, which
he is at liberty to fit up and to secure as he pleases. He ships
his goods, and accompanies them in person, or sends his son,
or a near relation, for it rarely happens that they will trust
each other with property, where no family connexion exists.
Each sleeping place is just the length and breadth of a man,
and contains only a small mat, spread on the floor, and a pillow.
Behind the compass is generally placed a small temple,
with an altar, on which is continually kept burning a spiral
taper composed of wax, tallow and sandal-wood dust. This
holy flame answers a double purpose; for while the burning
of it fulfils an act of piety, its twelve equal divisions serve
to measure the twelve portions of time, which make up a
complete day. It should seem that the superstitious notions
inculcated in the people have led them to suppose, that some
particular influence resides in the compass; for, on every appearance
of a change in the weather, they burn incense before
the magnetic needle.</p>

<p>The losses occasioned among the ships that were employed
to transport the taxes paid in kind from the ports of the
southern and middle provinces to the northern capital, were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
great, at the time of the Tartar Conquest, in the thirteenth
century, that the successors of Gengis-Khan were induced to
open a direct communication between the two extremes of the
empire, by means of the rivers and canals; an undertaking
that reflects the highest credit on the Mongul Tartars, and
which cannot fail to be regarded with admiration, as long as it
shall continue to exist. The Chinese, however, say, that the
Tartars only repaired the old works that were fallen into
decay.</p>

<p>Six centuries previous to this period, or about the seventh
century of the Christian æra, the Chinese merchants, according
to the opinion of the learned and ingenious Mr. de Guignes,
carried on a trade to the west coast of North America. That,
at this time, the promontory of Kamskatka was known to
them under the name of <i>Ta-Shan</i>, many of their books of
travels sufficiently testify; but their journies thither were generally
made by land. One of the missionaries assured me that,
in a collection of travels to Kamskatka, by various Chinese,
the names of the several Tartar tribes, their manners, customs,
and characters, the geographical descriptions of lakes, rivers,
and mountains, were too clearly and distinctly noted to be mistaken.
It is, however, extremely probable that, as furs and
peltry were always in great demand, they might also have some
communication with the said promontory from the isles of
Jesso, to which they were known to trade with their shipping;
and which are only a very short distance from it. Mr. de
Guignes, in support of his opinion, quotes the journal of a
bonze, as the priests of Fo have usually been called, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sailed eastward from Kamskatka to such a distance as, in his
mind, puts it beyond a doubt that the country he arrived at
was no other than the coast of California. The Spanish writers,
indeed, of the early voyages to this country, make mention of
various wrecks of Chinese vessels being found in different parts
of the western coast of the New Continent; and they observe
that the natives here were, invariably, more civilized than in
the interior and eastern parts of America.</p>

<p>Even those on the eastern coast of South America have a
very strong resemblance to the Chinese in their persons, though
not in their temperament and manners. The Viceroy of the
Brazils retains a dozen of these people in his service, as rowers
of his barge, with the use of which he one day honoured us,
to make the tour of the grand harbour of Rio de Janeiro.
We observed the Tartar or Chinese features, particularly the
eye, strongly marked in the countenances of these Indians; the
copper tinge was rather deeper than the darkest of the Chinese;
but their beards being mostly confined to the upper lip and
the point of the chin, together with their strong black hair,
bore a very near resemblance.</p>

<p>The island of Tcho-ka, or Saghalien, in the Tartarian sea,
opposite the mouth of the Amour, has evidently been peopled
by the Chinese. When Monsieur la Perouse visited this island,
he found the inhabitants clothed in blue nankin, and "the
form of their dress differed but little from that of the
Chinese; their pipes were Chinese, and of <a name="Tootanague" id="Tootanague"></a>Tootanague; they
had long nails; and they saluted by kneeling and prostration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
like the Chinese. If," continues the navigator, "they have a
common origin with the Tartars and Chinese their separation
from these nations must be of very ancient date, for
they have no resemblance to them in person, and little in manners."
Yet from his own account it appears that both their
manners and customs have a very close resemblance.</p>

<p>The Chinese at one period carried on a very considerable
commerce with Bussora and other sea-ports in the Persian
gulph, particularly <i>Siraff</i>, near which some small islands, as
well as several remarkable points and headlands of the coast,
still bear Chinese names. In some of the voyages it is observed
that a Colony of Chinese had apparently settled in the kingdom
of Soffala, the descendants of whom were, in the time of the
writers, easily distinguished from the other natives, by the difference
of their colour and their features. The early Portuguese
navigators also observe that on the island St. Laurence
or Madagascar they met with people that resembled the Chinese.
That the celebrated traveller Marco Polo visited Madagascar
in a Chinese vessel there can be little doubt, unless indeed,
like his own countrymen, we chuse rather to reject the probable
parts of his narrative as fabulous, and to believe the miracles
performed by the Nestorian Christians in Armenia as the only
truths in his book.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to consider the notices given by this early
traveller as curious, interesting and valuable; and, as far as
they regard the empire of China, they bear internal evidence of
being generally correct. He sailed from China in a fleet con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>sisting
of fourteen ships, each carrying <i>four</i> masts, and having
their holds partitioned into separate chambers, some containing
<i>thirteen</i> distinct compartments. This is the exact number of
divisions into which <i>all</i> the holds of those sea-faring vessels
were partitioned that transported the presents and baggage from
our own ships in the gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i> into the river <i>Pei-ho</i>;
and we observed many hundreds of a still larger description, that
are employed in foreign voyages, all carrying <i>four</i> masts; such vessels,
our sailors who are remarkable for metamorphosing foreign
names, usually called <i>Junks</i>, from <i>Tehuan</i> which signifies a ship; the
<i>Tsong-too</i> or viceroy of a province is called by them <i>John Tuck</i>.</p>

<p>Not only the form of the ships, but the circumstances of the
voyage taken notice of by this ancient navigator stamp his relation
with authenticity. The strong current between Madagascar
and Zanzebar rendering it next to impossible for ships to get
back to the northward; the black natives on that coast, the
products of the country which he enumerates; the true description
of the <a name="Giraffe" id="Giraffe"></a>Giraffe or Camelopardalis, at that time considered in
Europe as a fabulous animal, are so many and such strong evidences
in favour of his narrative, as to leave little doubt that he either
was himself upon the east coast of Africa, or that he had received
very correct information from his Chinese shipmates concerning
it. Yet Doctor Vincent has asserted, in his <i>Periplus of the Erythrean
Sea</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, that in the time of this Venetian traveller none but
Arab or Malay vessels navigated the Indian Ocean. With all due
deference to such high authority I cannot forbear observing that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>simple relation of Marco Polo bears internal and irresistible evidence
that the fleet of ships in which he sailed were Chinese, of
the same kind to all intents and purposes as they now are.
Nor have we any reason for doubting the authority of the two
Mahomedans who visited China in the ninth century, when
they tell us that Chinese ships traded to the Persian gulph at
that time. In a chart made under the direction of the Venetian
traveller and still preserved in the church of St. Michael de
Murano at Venice, the southern part of the continent of Africa is
said to be distinctly marked down, though this indeed might
have been inserted after the Cape of Good Hope had been
doubled by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Whether the Prince of Portugal had seen or heard of this
chart, or consulted the Arabian Geographers, or had read of the
circumnavigation of Africa in the first translation of Herodotus
that made its appearance but a few years before the discovery
of the southern promontory of this continent by Bartholomew
Diaz; or whether the voyages were undertaken at that time
on a general plan of discovery, authors seem not to have
agreed, but the opinion, I understand, among the Portugueze is
that Henry had good grounds for supposing that the circumnavigation
of Africa was practicable.</p>

<p>And whether the Ph&oelig;nicians did or did not, in the earliest
periods of history, double the Cape of Good of Hope there
is abundant reason for supposing they were well acquainted with
the east coast of Africa as far as the <i>Cape of Currents</i>. Nor is it
probable that the extent and flourishing condition of the trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and commerce of <i>Tyrus</i> should have been limited to that part
of the Indian ocean to the southward of the Red Sea, which is
a more difficult navigation than to the northward. That this
commerce was extensive we have the authority of the prophet
Ezekiel, who, in glowing terms, has painted its final destruction,
and who, it may be remarked, is supposed to have lived at the
very time the Ph&oelig;nicians sailed round Africa by order of Necho.
"Thy riches and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners and
thy pilots, thy caulkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandize,
and all thy men of war that are in thee, and in all thy
company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the
midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin." It is probable therefore
that the navigation of the Eastern Seas was known in the
earliest periods of history, and there seems to be no reason for
supposing that the Chinese should not have had their share in it.</p>

<p>Without, however, making any enquiry into the probability
that an ancient intercourse might have subsisted between
China and the East coast of Africa, either by convention for
commercial purposes, or that Chinese sailors might have been
thrown on that coast either in Ph&oelig;nician, or Arabian, or their own
vessels, I happened to observe in a former publication of "<i>Travels
in Southern Africa</i>," as a matter of fact, "that the upper lid of
the eye of a real Hottentot, as in that of a Chinese, was
rounded into the lower on the side next the nose, and that it
formed not an angle as in the eye of an European&mdash;that
from this circumstance they were known in the colony of
the Cape by the name of <i>Chinese Hottentots</i>." Further observations
have confirmed me in the very striking degree of resemblance
between them. Their physical characters agree in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
almost every point. The form of their persons in the remarkable
smallness of the joints and the extremities, their voices and
manner of speaking, their temper, their colour and features, and
particularly that singular shaped eye rounded in the corner next
the nose like the end of an ellipsis, probably of Tartar or Scythian
origin, are nearly alike. They also agree in the broad root
of the nose; or great distance between the eyes: and in the
oblique position of these, which, instead of being horizontal,
as is generally the case in European subjects, are depressed
towards the nose. A Hottentot who attended me in travelling
over Southern Africa was so very like a Chinese servant I had
in Canton, both in person, features, manners, and tone of voice,
that almost always inadvertently I called him by the name of
the latter. Their hair, it is true, and that only differs. This,
in a Hottentot, is rather harsh and wiry, than woolly, neither
long, nor short, but twisted in hard curling ringlets resembling
fringe. I possess not a sufficient degree of skill in physiology
to say what kind of hair the offspring would have of a Chinese
man and Mozambique woman; much less can I pretend
to account for the origin of the Hottentot tribes, insulated on
the narrow extremity of a large continent, and differing so
remarkably from all their neighbours, or where to look for
their primitive stock unless among the Chinese.</p>

<p>I am aware it will appear rather singular to those, who may
have attended to the accounts that generally have been given
of these two people, to meet with a comparison between the
most polished and the most barbarous, the wisest and the most
ignorant of mankind; and I am therefore the less surprized at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
at an observation made by the writers of the Critical Review
"that the f&oelig;tus of the Hottentots may resemble the Chinese, as
the entrails of a pig resemble those of a man; but on this
topic our ingenious author seems to wander beyond the circle
of his knowledge." I hope these gentlemen will not be offended
at my taking this occasion to assure them that the comparison
was not even then made on loose grounds, although no
inference was drawn from it, and that on a closer examination,
I am the more convinced of their near resemblance in
mental as well as physical qualities. The aptitude of a Hottentot
in acquiring and combining ideas is not less than of a Chinese,
and their powers of imitation are equally great, allowance
being made for the difference of education; the one being continually
from his infancy brought up in a society where all the
arts and conveniences of life are in common use; the other
among a miserable race of beings in constant want even of the
common necessaries of life.</p>

<p>But as assertions and opinions prove nothing, I have annexed
the portrait of a real Hottentot, drawn from the life by Mr. S.
Daniell, in order to compare it with one of a Chinese, taken also
from the life by Mr. Alexander; and I have no doubt that a
close comparison of these portraits will convince the reader, as
well as the reviewer, that the resemblance I remarked to have
found was not altogether fanciful.</p>

<p class="sbs">Indeed the people that have derived their origins from the
same stock with the Chinese, are more widely scattered over
the Asiatic continent and the oriental islands than is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>imagined. All those numerous societies, known under
the common name of Malays, are unquestionably descended
from the ancient inhabitants of Scythia or Tartary; and it may
perhaps be added, that their connection with the Arabs and
their conversion to Islamism first inspired, and have now rendered
habitual, that cruel and sanguinary disposition for which
they are remarkable; for it has been observed that the natives of
those islands, to which the baleful influence of this religion has
not extended, have generally been found a mild and inoffensive
people; as was the case with regard to the natives of the
Pelew islands when discovered by Captain Wilson.</p>

<p>The perusal of Mr. Marsden's excellent history of Sumatra
leaves little doubt on my mind that a Chinese colony at some
early period has settled on that island. This author observes
that the eyes of the Sumatrans are little, and of the same
kind as those of the Chinese; that they suffer their nails to
grow long; that they excel in working fillagree, making gunpowder,
&amp;c. that they register events by making knots on cords;
that they count decimally, write with a style on bamboo; that
they have little hair on their bodies and heads, which little, like the
Chinese, they extract. In their language, many words, I perceive,
are similar; and the corresponding words express the same idea
in both languages; but on etymological comparisons I would be
understood to lay little stress, for reasons which will be assigned in
the sixth chapter. The similitude of a religious ceremony is much
stronger ground to build upon; and the coincidence is sufficiently
remarkable, that the manner practised by the Sumatrans
in taking a solemn oath should exactly agree with the same ce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>remony
which is used in giving a solemn pledge among the
common people of China, namely, by wringing off the head of
a cock. Captain Mackintosh told me that having once occasion
to place great confidence in the matter of a Chinese vessel, and
doubting lest he might betray it, the man felt himself considerably
hurt, and said he would give him sufficient proof that
he was to be trusted. He immediately procured a cock, and,
falling down on both knees, wrung off his head; then holding
up his hands towards heaven, he made use of these words:
"If I act otherwise than as I have said, do thou, <i>o tien</i>, (Heaven)
deal with me as I have dealt with this cock!"</p>

<p>I have since been informed, from the best authority, that
whenever, in the course of the concerns of the British East
India Company with the merchants of China, it may be necessary
to administer an oath to a Chinese, the same ceremony
is gone through of wringing off the head of a cock, which is
by them considered in a very serious light, a sort of incantation,
whose effects upon their minds are not unlike those produced
by supposed magic spells, once common in our own country,
by which the vulgar were persuaded that the Devil was to be
made to appear before them. In a Chinese court of justice an
oath is never administered. In a late affair, where a Chinese
was killed by a seaman of a British man of war, and the Captain
was about to administer an oath to two of his people
whom he produced as evidences in a Chinese court of justice,
the chief judge was so shocked, that he ordered the court to
be instantly cleared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Cingalese</i> are unquestionably of Chinese origin. Those
who are acquainted with the Chinese manners and character,
will immediately perceive the very close resemblance, on reading
Mr. Boyd's relation of his embassy to the King of Candy.
<i>Sin-quo</i>, kingdom of <i>Sin</i>, (from whence Sina, or China,) are
Chinese words; the termination is European. So also is the
name of the island Chinese, <i>See-lan</i>, <i>See-long</i>, or <i>See-lung</i>, the
Western Dragon, in conformity to an invariable custom of
assigning the name of some animal to every mountain.</p>

<p>Having no intention, however, to investigate minutely the
extent of Chinese navigation and commerce in ancient times,
but rather to confine my observations to their present state,
I return from this digression, in order to proceed on our
voyage.</p>

<p>One of the small brigs, attending the expedition, was dispatched
without loss of time to the port of <i>Chu-san</i>, to take
on board the pilots that, agreeable to the order contained in
the Imperial edict, were expected to be found in readiness to
embark. In some of the passages, formed by the numerous
islands, the currents ran with amazing rapidity, appearing
more like the impetuous torrents of rivers, swelled
by rains, than branches of the great ocean. The depth too
of these narrow passages was so great as to make it difficult,
dangerous, and frequently impossible, for ships to anchor in
the event of a calm; in which case they must necessarily drive
at the mercy of the stream. As we approached, in the Clarence
brig, the high rocky point of the continent called <i>Kee-too</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which juts into the midst of the cluster of islands, the wind
suddenly failed us; and the current hurried us with such velocity
directly towards the point, that we expected momentarily
to be dashed in pieces; but on coming within twice the length
of the ship of the perpendicular precipice, which was some
hundred feet high, the eddy swept her round three several times
with great rapidity. The Captain would have dropped the
anchor, but an old Chinese fisherman, whom we had taken
on board to pilot us, made signs that it was too deep, and, at
the same time, that there was no danger, except that of the
bowsprit striking against the mountain. The Chinese vessels
have no bowsprit. At this moment the lead was thrown, but
we got no soundings at the depth of one hundred and twenty
fathoms; yet the yellow mud was brought up from the bottom
in such quantities, that the Nile, at the height of its inundations,
or the great Yellow River of China, could not be more
loaded with mud than the sea was in the whirlpool of <i>Kee-too</i>
point. The current, in the Strait of Faro, setting directly
upon the rocks of Scylla, and the whirlpool of Charybdis,
those celebrated objects of dread to ancient navigators, could not
possibly have been more awfully terrific, though perhaps more
dangerous, than the currents and the eddies that boiled tumultuously
round this promontory of the Chinese continent, where,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves<br />
The rough rock roars, tumultuous boil the waves;<br />
They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise,<br />
Like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze."<br />
</div></div>

<p>The second whirl removed us to a considerable distance from
the point, and, after the third, we were swept rapidly along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in a smooth uniform current. Our interpreter, a Chinese
priest, who had been educated in the college <i>de propaganda fide</i>
at Naples, was not quite so composed as his countryman the
pilot. The poor fellow, indeed, had nearly been thrown
overboard by the boom of the mainsail, in the first, which was
the most rapid, whirl of the ship; the same blow striking a
sailor tossed his hat overboard; and it afforded some amusement,
in our supposed perilous situation, to hear the different
ejaculations of these two persons on the same occasion.
<i>Sanctissima Maria, est miraculum, est miraculum!</i> exclaimed the
priest, with great eagerness; whilst the sailor, rubbing his head,
and walking away, with much composure observed, <i>that the
d&mdash;n'd boom had carried away his fore-top-gallant cap!</i></p>

<p>The Chinese, it seemed, had already been apprized of our
arrival, for we had not proceeded far before a large vessel bore
down towards us, and, hailing the brig in their own language,
desired we would bring her to anchor, and that they would conduct
us early the following morning into the harbour of Chu-san.
Some of the officers came on board, were extremely civil, and
presented us with a basket of fruit; but they affected to know
nothing of the occasion that had brought us thither. Our old
fisherman took out of the sea, (among thousands that had
floated round out vessel) one of those animal substances which,
I believe, we vulgarly call <i>sea blubbers</i> (<span class="smcap">Mollusca</span> <i>medusa
porpita</i>). If was at least a foot in diameter. Having dressed it
for his supper, and seeing it wear the inviting appearance of a
transparent colourless jelly, I was tempted to taste it; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
effect produced by this, or the fruit, or both, was a severe
sickness, which continued for several days.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor at day-break, and, with a pleasant
breeze, sailed in company with the clumsy-looking <i>junk</i>, which,
however, to the surprise of our seamen, sailed quite as well as
the smart-looking Clarence.</p>

<p>Having anchored before the town, in a spacious bason
formed by several islands, and paid the usual compliment of a
salute, a few Mandarines (officers of government so named
by the early Portugueze from <i>mandar</i>, to command) came on
board. To every question that led to the main point of our
visit, these people gave us evasive answers, affecting the most
complete ignorance of every thing relating to the affairs of the
embassy. They said the <i>Tsung-ping</i>, or military governor of
the island, was then absent, but that he would return in the
course of the day, and would be happy to see us on shore the
following morning. Chinese etiquette, I suppose, required that
a day should elapse before our reception in form.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at an early hour in the morning the gentlemen
of the embassy, who had been sent on this business, went on
shore, and were received by the Governor with great politeness,
and abundant ceremony, in his hall of public audience,
which, as a building, had little to attract our notice. The
usual minute enquiries being gone through, which, it seems,
Chinese good-breeding cannot dispense with, such as the health
of his visitors, of their parents and relations, and particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the name and age of each person, the object of our visit was
explained to him; and at the same time a hope expressed that
there would be no delay in getting the pilots on board. The
old gentleman appeared to be much surprized at such violent
haste, and talked of plays, feasts, and entertainments, that he
meant to give us. Pilots, however, he said, were ready to
take charge of the ships, and to carry them along the coast to
the next province, where others would be found to conduct
them still farther. On being told that such a mode of navigation
was utterly impracticable for the large English ships, and
that such pilots would be of no use to us, he begged to be
allowed the remainder of the day to enquire for others. We
little expected to have met with any difficulties with regard to
pilots, in one of the best and most frequented ports in China,
where, at that time several hundred vessels were lying at anchor.
The remainder of the day was spent in a visit to the city of
<i>Ting-hai</i>; but the crowd became so numerous, and the day
was so excessively hot, that before we had passed the length of
a street, we were glad to take refuge in a temple, where the
priests very civilly entertained us with tea, fruit, and cakes.
The officer who attended us advised us to return in sedan
chairs, an offer which we accepted; but the bearers were
stopped every moment by the crowd, in order that every one
might satisfy his curiosity by thrusting his head in at the window,
and exclaiming, with a grin, <i>Hung-mau! Englishman</i>,
or, literally, <i>Redpate!</i> Rather disappointed than gratified, we
were glad, after a fatiguing day, to throw ourselves into our
cots on board the Clarence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>When we went on shore the following morning, we found
the military governor, attended by a civil magistrate, by whom,
after the usual compliments, we were addressed, in a long oration,
delivered apparently with a great deal of solemnity, the
intention of which was to convince us that, as it had been the
practice of the Chinese, for time immemorial, to navigate from
port to port, experience had taught them it was the best.
Finding, however, that his eloquence could not prevail on his
hearers to relinquish their own opinions on the subject, the
governor and he consulted together for some time, and at
length resolved that a general muster should be made of all the
persons in that place, who had at any time visited by sea the
port of <i>Tien-sing</i>.</p>

<p>A number of soldiers were accordingly dispatched, and soon
returned, with a set of the most miserable-looking wretches I
ever beheld; who were thrust into the hall, and dropping on
their knees, were examined in that attitude, as to their qualifications.
Some, it appeared, had been at the port of <i>Tien-sing</i>,
but were no seamen; others followed the profession, but had
never been at that port; and several were hauled in, who had
never set a foot on board a vessel of any description whatsoever.
In short, the greater part of the day was consumed to no purpose;
and we were about to conclude that we had a great
chance of leaving the central and much frequented harbour of
<i>Chu-san</i>, without being able to procure a single pilot, when
two men were brought in, who seemed to answer the purpose
better than any which had yet been examined. It appeared,
however, that they had quitted the sea for many years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
being comfortably settled in trade, had no desire to engage in
the present service; on the contrary, they begged on their
knees that they might be excused from such an undertaking.
Their supplications were of no avail. The Emperor's orders
must be obeyed. In vain did they plead the ruin of their
business by their absence, and the distress it would occasion to
their wives, their children, and their families. The Governor
was inexorable; and they were ordered to be ready to embark
in the course of an hour.</p>

<p>This arbitrary proceeding of the Governor conveyed no very
exalted ideas of the justice or moderation of the government,
or of the protection it afforded to the subject. To drag away
from his family an honest and industrious citizen, settled in
trade, and to force him into a service that must be ruinous to
his concerns, was an act of injustice and violence that could
not be tolerated in any other than a despotic government,
where the subject knows no laws but the will of the tyrant.
But we are yet on a distant island of the Great Empire, remote
from the fountain of authority; and delegated power, in all
countries, is but too liable to be abused. Besides, a Chinese
might be impressed with sentiments equally unfavourable of our
government, were he informed of the manner in which imperious
necessity sometimes requires our navy to be manned.</p>

<p>One consideration, however, might with safety be drawn
from the occurrences of this day, which was this, that long
voyages are never undertaken where they can be avoided; but
that the commerce of the Yellow Sea is carried on from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
port to port; and that the articles of merchandize so transported
must necessarily have many profits upon them, before
they come to the distant consumer; which may, in some
degree, account for the high prices many of the products of the
country, as we afterwards found, bore in the capital. In like
manner was the inland commerce of Asia conducted by caravans,
proceeding from station to station, at each of which were
merchants to buy or exchange commodities with each other,
those at the limits of the journey having no connection nor
communication whatsoever with one another; which will partly
explain the ignorance of the Greeks with regard to the Eastern
countries, from whence they derived their precious stones, perfumes,
and other valuable articles.</p>

<p>The old Governor was evidently relieved from a load of
anxiety at his success; and the tears and entreaties of the poor
men served only to brighten up his countenance. From
civility, or curiosity, or perhaps both, he returned our visit on
board the brig, which had been crowded with the natives from
morning till night, since her first arrival in the harbour. The
want of curiosity, which has been supposed to form a part of
the Chinese character, was not perceived in this instance; but
it was that sort of curiosity, which appeared rather to be incited
by the desire of looking narrowly at the persons of those who
were to have the honour of being presented to their Great
Emperor, than for the sake of gratifying the eye or the mind,
by the acquirement of information or new ideas. The vessel,
although so very different from their own, was an object of
little notice; and although eager to get a transient glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the passengers, their curiosity was satisfied in a moment, and
was generally accompanied with some vague exclamation,
in which the words <i>Ta-whang-tee</i> occurred; and the main
drift of which seemed to imply, "is this person to appear
before our Great Emperor?" This was still more remarkable
in the crowd of <i>Ting-hai</i>; nothing scarcely was there heard
but the words <i>Ta-whang-tee</i> and <i>Hung-mau</i>, the Emperor and
the Englishman.</p>

<p>The squadron had scarcely got under way, and cleared the
narrow passages between the islands into the Yellow Sea,
when it was perceived how very little advantage it was likely
to derive from the Chinese pilots. One of them, in fact, had
come on board without his compass, and it was in vain to
attempt to make him comprehend ours. The moveable card
was to him a paradox, as being contrary to the universal
practice with them, of making the needle traverse the fixed points,
and not the points described on the card to move (by the needle
being attached to the card), as in those of Europe. The other
was furnished with a compass, about the size of a common
snuff-box, being an entire piece of wood, with a circular
excavation in the centre, just large enough to admit the vibration
of a very fine steel needle, not quite an inch in length, which,
however, might be found sufficiently useful, in their short
voyages, by means of a peculiar contrivance for preserving the
center of gravity, in all positions of the ship, in coincidence
nearly with the center of suspension. Nor is it necessary, in
so short and fine a needle, to load one end more than the other,
in order to counteract the dip, or tendency that the magnetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
needle is known to have, more or less, towards the horizon
in different parts of the world. The Chinese, however, do
not seem to have adopted their small needle from any knowledge
either of the variation, or of the inclination of the magnetic
needle. Although the needle be invariably small, yet it
sometimes happens that the margin of the box is extended to
such a size, as to contain from twenty to thirty concentric
circles, containing various characters of the language, constituting
a compendium of their astronomical (perhaps more
properly speaking) astrological knowledge. As numbers of
such compasses are in the museums of Europe, it may not perhaps
be wholly unacceptable to give some notion of what these
circles of characters contain.</p>

<p>The greatest depth of the Yellow Sea, in the track of the
ships, did not exceed thirty-six fathoms, and it was frequently
diminished to ten fathoms. The weather, as usually happens
in shallow seas, was generally hazy. In doubling the
projecting promontory of the province of Shan-tung, the
land was hidden in thick fogs. And on these, fortunately,
dissipating, it was perceived that the whole squadron was
within four miles of the main land, and one of the ships close
upon a rocky island. The pilots were as ignorant of our situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>tion
as the meanest sailor in the squadron. Proceeding to the
westward, a capacious bay was discovered. One of the pilots,
after a minute examination of the land, which was now clear,
asserted that he knew the place very well; that it was the bay
of <i>Mee-a-taw</i>. The confidence with which he spoke, and
the vast concourse of people, crowding down towards the
shore, as if expecting our arrival, induced the Commander to
steer directly into the bay: but the depth of water diminishing
to five fathoms, and land appearing on every side, it was thought
prudent to let go the anchor. Several boats from the shore were
presently along-side; and we were soon convinced how little we
had to trust to the knowledge of our pilots, even within sight
of land. We were informed that the bay was called <i>Kee-san-seu</i>,
and that <i>Mee-a-taw</i> was, at least, fifteen leagues farther to
the westward.</p>

<p>The hills along this southern coast of the gulph of Pe-tche-lee
have a very peculiar character. They are all of the same form
and nearly of the same size, being regular cones with smooth
sides as if fashioned by art, and entirely detached, each standing
on its proper base, resembling in their shapes the summer caps
worn by the officers of government; and having, as yet, no
European names, they were noticed in the journals by the appellation
of the first, second, third, &amp;c., mandarin's bonnets.</p>

<p>Determining now to avail ourselves of the advice given by
the magistrate of <i>Chu-san</i>, and to navigate from port to port,
we here procured two new pilots to carry the ships to <i>Mee-a-taw</i>.
They brought us indeed to this place, but, instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
harbour, we found only a narrow strait, with a rapid tide setting
through it, and rocky anchoring ground. On the shore
of the continent was a city of considerable extent, under the walls
of which next the sea was a bason or dock, filled with vessels
whose capacity might be from ten to one hundred tons.</p>

<p>The Governor of this city (the name of which we learned to
be <i>Ten-tchoo-foo</i>) paid his respects to the embassador on board
the Lion, and observed in the course of conversation that his
orders from court were to render all the service in his power to
the embassy, and to provide proper means of conveyance, either
by land or by sea. He seemed to be about the age of five and
thirty, a man of frank and easy manners, courteous, intelligent,
and inquisitive. He stood higher in the opinion of all of us
than any we had yet seen. The following morning he sent off
what he was pleased to call a trifling refreshment, which consisted
of four bullocks, eight sheep, eight goats, five sacks of
fine white rice, five sacks of red rice, two hundred pounds of
flour, and several baskets of fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>We have always been taught to believe that the Chinese consider
us as barbarians; but we have hitherto no reason to say
that they treated us as such. At all events it was obvious that
the expected arrival of the British embassy had made no slight
impression on the court of Pekin.</p>

<p>Here we once more ventured on another pilot to carry the
ships across the gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i> to <i>Tien-sing</i>. He was an
old man of 70 years, and seemed to possess a perfect knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of all the bays and harbours in the gulph. He drew on paper
the sketch of a port on the western coast to which he undertook
to carry the ships. Fortunately, however, for us, it was considered
more safe to send the small brigs a-head to sound, than
to place any confidence in men who had already so often deceived
us. They had scarcely departed before the signal of
danger was made; a new course was steered for the night, and
early the following morning, the same signal was repeated.
No land was now in sight, yet the water had shallowed to six
fathoms; it was therefore deemed prudent to come to an anchor.
It was a very unusual situation for such large ships to
ride thus at anchor in the middle of a strange sea, and out of
sight of land, yet liable, in case of blowing weather, to strike
against the bottom.</p>

<p>The commanders of the ships were exasperated against the
pilots, and these on their part were almost petrified with fear.
The poor creatures had done their best, but they possessed neither
skill nor judgment, or, perhaps, it may be more charitable
to suppose that they were confused by the novelty of their situation.
It was in vain to endeavour to make them comprehend
the difference in the draught of water between their own
ships and ours, which, in the latter, was as many fathoms as
feet in the former, although they were palpably shewn, by a
piece of rope, the depth that was required.</p>

<p>As it was evidently impracticable to proceed farther with
our own ships towards the land, which was now from twelve
to fifteen miles distant, and so very low as not to be visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the deck, one of the tenders was dispatched to the mouth of
the <i>Pei-ho</i> or white river to report our arrival. Here two
officers from the court had already embarked to wait on the
Embassador, carrying with them a present of refreshments, consisting
of bullocks, hogs, sheep, poultry, wine, fruit, and vegetables,
in such quantities, as to be more than sufficient for a
a week's consumption of the whole squadron, amounting nearly
to six hundred men. It consisted in twenty small bullocks,
one hundred hogs, one hundred sheep, one thousand fowls,
three thousand pumpkins, as many melons, apples, pears,
plumbs, apricots, and other fruits, with an abundance of culinary
vegetables. The wine was contained in large earthen
jars whose covers were closely luted. Numbers of the hogs
and the fowls had been bruised to death on the passage, which
were thrown overboard from the Lion with disdain, but the
Chinese eagerly picked them up, washed them clean and laid
them in salt.</p>

<p>The number of vessels they had dispatched to take on shore
the presents and the baggage was between thirty and forty,
the capacity of each not being less, and many of them more,
than two hundred tons; so imperfect a judgment had these
people formed of the quantity of articles to be transhipped.
These were the vessels whose holds were divided into thirteen
distinct compartments, separated by partitions of two inch
plank, the seams of which were caulked with a preparation
of fine lime made from shells, and fibres of bamboo, in order
to render them water-tight. Their sails, cables, rigging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cordage were all made of bamboo; and neither pitch nor tar
was used on these or any part of the wood-work.</p>

<p>We detained about fifteen of these vessels to take on shore
the Embassador's suite, the presents for the Emperor, and the
baggage; after which the British ships returned to <i>Chu-san</i>
without the assistance of the Chinese pilots, whose skill in
navigation was held very cheap, by the lowest seamen on
board.</p>

<p>On entering the <i>Pei-ho</i> we observed a number of buildings
erected on the right bank, with roofs of matting, but decorated
in the most fantastical manner, with different coloured ribbands
and variegated silks; and about three hundred soldiers in their
uniforms (which appeared to our eye not much adapted to
military purposes) were drawn out, with a band of music,
near a temporary landing-place constructed of wood; all of
which we understood had been hastily prepared for the reception
of the Embassador; but as his Excellency was desirous of
reaching the capital without delay, he declined going on shore,
preferring to step into the accommodation yachts at once, that
were ready to receive him, a little higher up the river, the moment
that the presents should be transhipped into the river-craft.
The officers who were deputed to conduct him to the
capital observed, that so much haste was not at all necessary, as
the Emperor's birth-day was yet distant; these people having
no other idea of an embassy, as it seemed, than that of its being
a mere compliment to their Sovereign. The yellow flags dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>played
at the mast-heads of the river fleet, laden with the
presents, and consisting of seventeen sail, gave, indeed, a more
extended meaning of such a mission. These flags, in broad
black characters, bore the following inscription; <i>The English
Embassador carrying Tribute to the Emperor of China.</i></p>

<p>We found the yachts that were destined to convey us exceedingly
convenient, more so indeed than any I have seen on
our canals of England. They are flat bottomed, and draw
only about fifteen inches of water. Their upper works are
high, appearing indeed like a floating house. They have three
apartments for the accommodation of passengers; the first an
antichamber for the servants and baggage; the middle a commodious
sitting and dining room, about fifteen feet square;
and the third divided into two or three sleeping rooms. Behind
these is the kitchen; and still farther aft, small places like dog-kennels,
for the boatmen. Sometimes there is a kind of second
story, upon the apartments, divided into little cells, that are just
the length and breadth of a man. A Chinese sailor requires no
room for luggage, his whole wardrobe being generally on his
back. In the different operations employed for making the
yachts proceed, they give no interruption to the passengers.
A projecting gangway on each side of the vessel, made of broad
planks, serves as the passage from one end to the other.</p>

<p>The two officers that were sent from court, to conduct the Embassador
to the capital, paid a visit to every yacht, and shewed
the most earnest desire to please and to make us comfortable.
Their names were <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i>, to which they annexed the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of <i>Ta-gin</i>, or <i>great man</i>. <i>Van</i> had the rank of Lieutenant-General
in the army, and <i>Chou</i> was the Governor of a district in
<i>Pe-tche-lee</i>. We observed in their manners no indication of
that stiff and ceremonious conduct, which custom obliges them
to put on in public. On the contrary, they sat down to table
with us, endeavouring to learn the use of the knife and fork,
and made themselves extremely agreeable; lamented they were
not able to hold conversation with us in our own language;
and on going away, shook hands with us like Englishmen.</p>

<p>Provisions, fruit, and wines (such as the country affords)
were sent on board in such profusion, that I really believe the
Chinese boatmen, in the course of the passage up this river,
were enabled to lay by their winter's stock from the surplus.
In truth, as Sir George Staunton has observed, the hospitality,
attention, and respect we hitherto experienced, were such as
strangers meet with only in the Eastern parts of the world.</p>

<p>Nothing that could convey the idea of extraordinary wealth
or comfort among the inhabitants, or of extraordinary abundance
and fertility in the country, (unless in the copious supplies
of our provisions) had yet occurred, either at <i>Chu-san</i>
or in the first three days' sail up the <i>Pei-ho</i> towards the capital.
The land on both sides was low and flat, and instead of hedge-rows,
trenches were dug to mark the boundaries of property.
A small proportion only was under cultivation. The greater
part appeared to be sour swampy ground, covered with coarse
grass, with bushes, and the common reed. There were few
trees, except near the villages, which were of mean appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the houses generally consisting of mud walls, one story in
height, and thatched with straw or rushes. Here and there a
solitary cottage intervened, but nothing that bore any
resemblance to the residence of a gentleman, or that could even be
called a comfortable farm-house. And although villages were
numerous, no assemblage of houses were perceived, that properly
could be classed under the name of a town, except that
of <i>See-koo</i>, near the mouth of the river, and <i>Ta-koo</i>, a few
miles higher, until we proceeded to the distance of about ninety
miles, when we entered the suburbs of the large city of <i>Tien-sing</i>,
stretching, like London on the Thames, for several miles
along each bank of the river <i>Pei-ho</i>. But neither the buildings
nor the river would bear any comparison, even with those parts
about Redriffe and Wapping. Every thing, in fact, that we had
hitherto seen wore an air of poverty and meanness. After a long
confinement on board a ship, to those at least who are not accustomed
to it, almost any country appears to possess the charms
of a Paradise; yet on our first landing in this celebrated empire
to the present place, which is no great distance from the capital,
I am persuaded, that every individual of the embassy felt
himself rather disappointed in the expectations he had formed.
If any thing excited admiration, it was the vast multitudes of
people that, from our first arrival, had daily flocked down to the
banks of the river, of both sexes and of all ages. Their general
appearance, however, was not such as to indicate any
extraordinary degree of happiness or comfort. The best dressed
men wore a sort of velvet cap on their heads; a short jacket,
buttoned close round the neck, and folded across the breast, the
sleeves remarkably wide; the materials cotton cloth, black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
blue, or brown silk, or European camblet; they wore quilted
petticoats, and black sattin boots. The common people were
dressed in large straw hats, blue or black cotton frocks, wide
cotton trowsers, and thick clumsy shoes, sometimes made of straw.
Some had coarse stockings of cotton cloth; the legs of others
were naked. A single pair of drawers constituted indeed the
whole clothing of a great portion of the crowd.</p>

<p>Never were poor women fitted out in a style so disadvantageous
for setting off their charms as those who made their
appearance on the banks of the <i>Pei-ho</i>, and we afterwards
found that the dress of these, with some slight variations,
was the common mode of the country. Bunches of large
artificial flowers, generally resembling <i>asters</i>, whose colours
were red, blue, or yellow, were stuck in their jet-black hair,
which, without any pretensions to taste or freedom, was
screwed up close behind, and folded into a ridge or knot across
the crown of the head, not very unlike (except in the want of
taste) to the present mode in which the young ladies of England
braid their locks. Two bodkins of silver, brass, or iron,
were conspicuously placed behind the head, in the form of an
oblique cross, which is the common mode of Malay women.
Their faces and necks were daubed with white paint, the eye-brows
blackened, and on the center of the lower lip, and at
the point of the chin, were two spots, about the size of a small
wafer, of a deep vermillion colour. A blue cotton frock, like
that of the men, reaching in some to the middle of the thigh,
in others to the knee, was almost universal. A pair of wide
trowsers, of different colours, but commonly either red, green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or yellow, extended a little below the calf of the leg, where they
were drawn close, in order the better to display an ankle and a
foot, which for singularity at least, may challenge the whole
world. This distorted and disproportionate member consists
of a foot that has been cramped in its growth, to the length of
four or five inches, and an ankle that is generally swollen in the
same proportion that the foot is diminished. The little shoe is
as fine as tinsel and tawdry can make it, and the ankle is bandaged
round with party-coloured clothes, ornamented with
fringe and tassels; and such a leg and foot, thus dressed out,
are considered in China as superlatively beautiful.</p>

<p>The constant pain and uneasiness that female children must necessarily
suffer, in the act of compressing, by means of bandages,
the toes under the sole of the foot, and retaining them in that
position until they literally grow into and become a part of it;
and by forcing the heel forward, until it is entirely obliterated,
make it the more wonderful how a custom, so unnatural and
inhuman, should have continued for so many ages, at least
such is the opinion, that its origin is entirely unknown, or explained
by such fabulous absurdities as are too ridiculous to
assign for its adoption.</p>

<p>Few savage tribes are without the unnatural custom of
maiming or lopping off some part of the human body, as
boring the lips and the cartilege of the nose, drawing or
colouring the teeth, cutting off a joint from the fingers or toes,
and otherwise practising, as they must suppose, improvements
on nature. But on this consideration it would scarcely be fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to conclude, that maiming the feet of the Chinese ladies
derived its origin from a period of time when they were yet in
a savage state, since we are in the daily habit of observing the
most civilized and enlightened societies studying to find out
beauties in defects, and creating them where nature had
intended perfection. The Chinese would no doubt be equally
surprized at, and consider as egregiously absurd, the custom
of circumcision, as practiced by a great portion of Asiatic
nations; nor have we any reason to think they would not
condemn the refinement of docks and crops among our horses
as an absurd custom, not less ridiculous in their eyes, than the
little feet of their ladies are in ours. If they could not refrain
from bursting into fits of laughter on examining the grease and
powder with which our hair was disfigured; and if they sometimes
lamented that so much oil and flour had unnecessarily
been wasted, we might, perhaps, in the vanity of self-importance,
affect to pity their taste; but setting custom and prejudice
apart, we had certainly no great reason to despise and
ridicule the Chinese, or indeed any other nation, merely
because they differ from us in the little points of dress and
manners, seeing how very nearly we can match them with
similar follies and absurdities of our own.</p>

<p>The silence of the earliest travellers into China on so extraordinary
a custom, would almost warrant a conjecture that,
notwithstanding the pretended ignorance of the Chinese with
regard to its origin, both the fashion and the sentiment of its
being vulgar for ladies to be seen abroad, were only adopted
within the period of a few centuries. The Venetian traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
although he makes frequent mention of the beauty and
dress of the women, takes no notice of this singular fashion;
and he observes that on the lake of <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>
the ladies are accustomed to take their pleasure with their
husbands and their families. The Embassadors also of Shah
Rokh, the son of Tamerlane, who in the year 1419,
were sent to congratulate the Emperor of China, state in
the narrative of their expedition that, at their public reception,
there stood two young virgins, one on each side of the
throne, with their faces and bosoms uncovered; that they
were furnished with paper and pencils and took down
with great attention every word that the Emperor spoke.
These Embassadors saw also numbers of women in open
baths near the Yellow River; and, in one city, they remark
that "there were many taverns, at the doors of which sat a
number of young girls of extraordinary beauty." Nor do
the travels of two Mahomedans into China in the ninth
century, published by Mr. Renaudot, make any mention of
the unnatural smallness of the women's feet; and they are not
by any means deficient in their observations of the manners and
customs of this nation, at that time so very little known to
the rest of the world. Almost every thing they have related
concerning China at this early period is found to be true at
the present day, and as they particularly notice the dress
and ornaments worn by the women, one would think they
would not have omitted a custom so singular in its kind as that
of maiming the feet, if it had then been as common as it
now is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>This monstrous fashion has generally been attributed to the
jealousy of the men. Admitting this to have been the case,
the Chinese must be allowed to be well versed in the management
of the sex, to have so far gained the ascendancy over
them, as to prevail upon them to adopt a fashion, which required
a voluntary relinquishment of one of the greatest pleasures
and blessings of life, the faculty of locomotion; and to contrive
to render this fashion so universal that any deviation from it
should be considered as disgraceful. The desire of being
thought superior to the rest of his fellows sometimes, indeed,
leads a man into strange extravagancies. Upon this principle the
men of learning, as they are pleased to style themselves, suffer the
nails of their little fingers to grow sometimes to the enormous
length of three inches for the sole purpose of giving ocular demonstration
of the impossibility of their being employed in any
sort of manual labour; and upon the same principle, perhaps,
the ladies of China may be induced to continue the custom
of maiming their female infants, in order that their children
may be distinguished from those of the peasantry, who, in most
of the provinces, are condemned to submit to the drudgery of
the field.</p>

<p>The interior wrappers of the ladies' feet are said to be seldom
changed, remaining, sometimes, until they can no longer hold
together; a custom that conveys no very favourable idea of
Chinese cleanliness. This, indeed, forms no part of their character;
on the contrary they are what Swift would call a
<i>frowzy</i> people. The comfort of clean linen, or frequent change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of under-garments, is equally unknown to the Sovereign and to
the peasant. A sort of thin coarse silk supplies the place of cotton
or linen next the skin, among the upper ranks; but the
common people wear a coarse kind of open cotton cloth. These
vestments are more rarely removed for the purpose of washing
than for that of being replaced with new ones; and the consequence
of such neglect or economy is, as might naturally be supposed,
an abundant increase of those vermin to whose production
filthiness is found to be most favourable. The highest
officers of state made no hesitation of calling their attendants in
public to seek in their necks for those troublesome animals,
which, when caught, they very composedly put between their
teeth. They carry no pocket handkerchiefs, but generally blow
their noses into small square pieces of paper which some of
their attendants have ready prepared for the purpose. Many
are not so cleanly, but spit about the rooms, or against
the walls like the French, and they wipe their dirty hands in the
sleeves of their gowns. They sleep at night in the same clothes
they wear by day. Their bodies are as seldom washed as their
articles of dress. They never make use of the bath, neither
warm nor cold. Notwithstanding the vast number of rivers and
canals, with which every part of the country is intersected, I do
not remember to have seen a single groupe of boys bathing. The
men, in the hottest day of summer, make use of warm water
for washing the hands and face. They are unacquainted with
the use of soap. We procured, in Pekin, a sort of Barilla with
which and apricot oil we manufactured a sufficient quantity of
this article to wash our linen, which, however, we were under
the necessity of getting done by our own servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>On approaching the town of <i>Tien-sing</i> we observed a prodigious
number of large stacks of salt, piled up in sacks of matting. The
quantity thus stored was found, on rough calculation, to be sufficient
for the consumption of thirty millions of people, for a
whole year. Such a surprising aggregate of one of the useful and
almost necessary, articles of life, was a preparative, in some measure,
for the vast multitudes of people which appeared on our
passing this northern emporium of China. The gabelle, or
duty on salt, which the government here, as well as elsewhere,
had found convenient to impose on one of the indispensable
articles of life, partly accounted for such an extraordinary accumulation.
The collector of the salt duties of <i>Tien-sing</i>
held one of the most lucrative appointments in the gift of the
crown.</p>

<p>The crowds of large vessels lying close together along the
sides of the river; the various kinds of craft passing and re-passing;
the town and manufactories and warehouses extending on
each bank as far as the eye could reach, indicated a spirit of commerce
far beyond any thing we had hitherto met with. The
large vessels, the small craft, the boats, the shores, the walls
surrounding the houses, the roofs were all covered with spectators.
Our barges, being retarded in the narrow passages among
the shipping, were at least two hours in reaching the head of the
town. During the whole time the populace stood in the water,
the front rank up to the middle, to get a peep at the strangers.
Hitherto among the spectators there had generally appeared full
as many of the fair sex as of the other; and the elderly dames, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
particular, had been so curious as to dip their little stumps into
the water in order to have a peep into the barges as they glided
slowly along; but here, among the whole crowd, not a single
female was visible. Although the day was extremely sultry,
the thermometer of Fahrenheit being 88° in the shade, as a mutual
accommodation their heads were all uncovered, and their
bald pates exposed to the scorching rays of the sun. It was an
uncommon spectacle to see so many bronze-like heads stuck as
close together, tier above tier, as Hogarth's groupe, intended to
display the difference between character and caricature, but it
lacked the variety of countenance which this artist has, in an
inimitable manner, displayed in his picture.</p>

<p>The deep sounding <i>gong</i>, a sort of brazen kettle struck with
a mallet, and used in the barges to direct the motions of the
trackers on shore, the kettle-drums and the trumpets in the military
band, the shrill music and squalling recitative in the
theatre, which was entirely open in front, and facing the river in
full view of the crowd; the number of temporary booths and
buildings erected for the use of the viceroy, governor, judges,
and other officers of government, and gaily decorated with
ribbands and silken streamers; the buzz and merriment of the
crowd had, altogether, so striking an affinity to the usual entertainments
of Bartholomew fair, that no extraordinary stretch of
the imagination was required to suppose ourselves for the moment
to have been transported into Smithfield. We instantly acquitted
the Chinese of any want of curiosity. The arrival of Elfi Bey in
London drew not half the crowd; and yet the Chinese account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
us much greater barbarians than we pretend to consider the
mamelukes. The old viceroy of the province, a Tartar of mild
and winning manners, had prepared for us a most magnificent
entertainment with wine, fruits, and great variety of pastry and
sweetmeats, together with presents of tea, silk, and nankins,
not only to the Embassador and his suite, but also to the servants,
musicians, and soldiers.</p>

<p>The cheerful and good-natured countenances of the multitude
were extremely prepossessing; not less so their accommodating
behaviour to one another. There was an innocence and
simplicity in their features, that seemed to indicate a happy and
contented turn of mind. This, however, being a sort of gala
day, we might, on account of the extraordinary occasion, perhaps
have viewed them to the best advantage; yet the same cheerful
and willing mind had constantly shewn itself on all occasions,
by all those who were employed in the service of the embassy.
On board the yachts constant mirth and good humour prevailed
among the seamen. When the weather was calm, the vessels
were generally pushed on by means of two large sculls or oars
turning upon pivots that were placed in projecting pieces of
wood near the <i>bow</i> of the vessel, and not the stern, as is the
practice of most other nations. From six to ten men are required
to work one of these oars, which, instead of being taken
out of the water, as in the act of rowing, are moved backwards
and forwards under the surface, in a similar manner to what in
England is understood by sculling. To lighten their labour,
and assist in keeping time with the strokes, the following rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
air was generally sung by the master <a name="to" id="to"></a>to which the whole crew
used to join in chorus:</p>

<div class="center"><a href="music/air1.mid">MIDI</a></div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>On many a calm still evening, when a dead silence reigned
upon the water, have we listened with pleasure to this artless
and unpolished air, which was sung, with little alteration
through the whole fleet. Extraordinary exertions of bodily
strength, depending, in a certain degree, on the willingness of
the mind, are frequently accompanied with exhilarating exclamations
among the most savage people; but the Chinese song
could not be considered in this point of view; like the exclamations
of our seamen in hauling the ropes, or the oar song of
the Hebridians, which, as Doctor Johnson has observed, resembled
the proceleusmatick verse by which the rowers of Grecian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
galleys were animated, the chief object of the Chinese chorus
seemed to be that of combining chearfulness with regularity.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound."
</div></div>

<p>Of their honesty, sobriety, and carefulness, we had already received
convincing proofs. Of the number of packages,
amounting to more than six hundred, of various sizes and descriptions,
not a single article was missing nor injured, on their
arrival at the capital, notwithstanding they had been moved
about, and carried by land, and transhipped several times. Of
the three state-officers, who had been deputed from court to
attend the embassy, two of them were the most obliging and
attentive creatures imaginable. The third, a Tartar, who first
made his appearance at <i>Tien-sing</i>, was distant, proud, and imperious.
The Chinese indeed were invariably more affable
than the Tartars. In short, had we returned to Europe, without
proceeding farther in the country than <i>Tien-sing</i>, a most
lively impression would always have remained on my mind in
favour of the Chinese. But a variety of incidents that afterwards
occurred, and a more intimate acquaintance with their
manners and habits, produced a woeful change of sentiment in
this respect. Of such incidents, as may tend to illustrate the
moral character of this extraordinary people, I shall relate a few
that were the most striking, in taking a general view of their
state of society, to which, and to the nature of the executive
government, all their moral actions may be referred: and by
the influence of which, the natural bent of their character evidently
has undergone a complete change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving <i>Tien-sing</i> on the 11th of August, we found the
river considerably contracted in its dimensions, and the stream
more powerful. The surface of the country, in fact, began to
assume a less uniform appearance, being now partly broken
into hill and dale; but nothing approaching to a mountain was
yet visible in any direction. It was still however scantily
wooded, few trees appearing except large willows on the banks,
and knots of elms, or firs, before the houses of men in office,
and the temples, both of which were generally found at the
head of each village. More grain was here cultivated than on
the plains near the mouth of the river. Two species of millet,
the <i>panicum crus galli</i>, and the <i>italicum</i>, and two of a larger
grain, the <i>holcus sorghum</i>, and the <i>saccharatus</i>, were the most
abundant. We observed also a few patches of buck-wheat,
and different sorts of kidney-beans; but neither common wheat,
barley, nor oats. A species of nettle, the <i>urtica nivea</i> was also
sown in square patches, for the purpose of converting its fibres
into thread, of which they manufacture a kind of cloth. We
saw no gardens nor pleasure-grounds, but considerable tracts of
pasture or meadow-land intervened between the villages, on
which however were few cattle, and those few remarkably
small. Those we procured for the use of the ships along the
coast of the gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, seldom exceeded the weight of
two hundred pounds. The few sheep we saw were of the
broad-tailed species. The cottages of the peasantry were very
mean, without any appearance of comfort, and thinly scattered;
seldom standing alone, but generally collected into small
villages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>If, however, cities, towns, villages, and farm-houses, were
less abundant so near the capital, than from the relations of
travellers we had expected to find them, the multitudes of
inhabitants whose constant dwelling was on the water, amply
made up the apparent deficiency on shore. We passed, in one
day, upon this river, more than six hundred large vessels,
having each a range of ten or twelve distinct apartments built
upon the deck, and each apartment contained a whole family.
The number of persons in one of these vessels, we reckoned, on
an average, to be about fifty, and we actually counted above
one thousand vessels of this description, that were floating on that
part of the river, between <i>Tien-sing</i> and <i>Tong-tchoo</i>. The different
kinds of craft, besides these, that were perpetually passing
and re-passing, or lying chained to the banks of the river, all
of which were crowded with men, women, and children, contained
full as many as the large vessels above mentioned; so
that, in the distance of ninety miles, on this small branch
of a river, there were floating on the water not fewer than one
hundred thousand souls.</p>

<p>Among the different cargoes of cotton wool, copper-money,
rice, silk, salt, tea, and other commodities for the supply of the
capital, we observed an article of commerce, in several of the
large open craft, that puzzled us not a little to find out for
what it was intended. It consisted of dry brown cakes, not
much larger but thicker than those we call crumpets. A close
examination, however, soon discovered the nature of their
composition, which, it seemed, was a mixture of every kind of
filth and excrementitious substances, moulded into their present
shape, and dried in the sun. In this form they are carried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the capital as articles of merchandize, where they meet with a
ready market from the gardeners in the vicinity; who, after
dissolving them in urine, use them for manure.</p>

<p>Little occurred that was worthy of note, between <i>Tien-sing</i>
and <i>Tong-tchoo</i>, except an instance in the exercise of arbitrary
power, not less cruel than that of the Governor of <i>Chu-san</i>,
and ill agreeing with the feelings of Englishmen. Some of
our provisions happened one morning to be a little tainted,
which could not be wondered at, considering the heat of the
weather, the mercury, by Fahrenheit's scale, being from 82° to
88°. The officers, however, who had been commissioned to
furnish the supply of provisions, were instantly deprived of their
rank, and all their servants severely bambooed. The Embassador
interceded with <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i> in favour of the degraded
delinquents, was heard with great attention, but perceived
that little indulgence or relaxation from strict discipline
was to be expected on such occasions.</p>

<p>The whole distance, from the entrance of the <i>Pei-ho</i> to the
city of <i>Tong-tchoo</i> is about one hundred and seventy miles.
Here we found two buildings, that had been erected in the
space of two days, for the temporary purpose of receiving the
presents and baggage; and they were constructed of such large
dimensions, that they were capable of containing at least ten
times the quantity. The materials were wooden poles and
mats, and a fence of wooden paling surrounded the whole.</p>

<p>We took up our lodging in a spacious temple in the suburbs,
from whence the priests were turned out without the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ceremony, to make room for us, consisting in the whole of one
hundred persons nearly. And here it was settled we should
remain until every article was landed, and coolies or porters
procured sufficient to carry the whole at once to Pekin, which
was computed to be about twelve miles to the westward from
this place. And although near three thousand men were
required for this purpose, they were supplied the instant the
goods were all on shore; nor did it appear that any difficulty
would have been found in raising double that number, as there
seemed to be ten times the number of idle spectators as of
persons employed. The plain between the landing-place and
the temple was like a fair, and cakes, rice, tea, and fruit upon
masses of ice, and many other refreshments were exposed for
sale, under large square umbrellas, that served instead of booths.
A slice of water-melon, cooled on ice, was sold for one <i>tchen</i>, a
piece of base copper coin, of the value of about three-tenths of
a farthing. Not a single woman appeared among the many
thousand spectators that were assembled on the plain.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> presents for the Emperor and our private baggage being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
all landed, the packages repaired, and every article minutely
noted down by the officers of government, the porters were
directed to fix their bamboo bearing poles to each package, that
no impediment might prevent our setting out at an early hour
in the morning. In doing this, as well as in landing the articles
from the vessels, the Chinese porters shewed such expedition,
strength, and activity, as could not, I believe, be pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>rallel
or procured in so short a time, in any other country.
Every thing here, in fact, seems to be at the instant command
of the state; and the most laborious tasks are undertaken and
executed with a readiness, and even a chearfulness, which one
could scarcely expect to meet with in so despotic a government.</p>

<p>According to the arrangement, on the 21st of August about
three o'clock in the morning, we were prepared to set out, but
could scarcely be said to be fairly in motion till five, and before
we had cleared the city of <i>Tong-tchoo</i>, it was past six o'clock.
From this city to the capital, I may venture to say, the road
never before exhibited so motley a groupe. In front marched
about three thousand porters, carrying six hundred packages;
some of which were so large and heavy, as to require thirty-two
bearers, with these were mixed a proportionate number of
inferior officers, each having the charge and superintendence of
a division. Next followed eighty-five waggons, and thirty-nine
hand-carts, each with one wheel, loaded with wine, porter
and other European provisions, ammunition, and such
heavy articles as were not liable to be broken. Eight light
field pieces, which were among the presents for the Emperor,
closed this part of the procession. After these paraded the
Tartar legate, and several officers from court, with their numerous
attendants; some on horseback, some in chairs, and others
on foot. Then followed the Embassador's guard in waggons,
the servants, musicians, and mechanics, also in waggons; the
gentlemen of the suite on horseback, the Embassador, the Minister
Plenipotentiary, his son, and the interpreter, in four ornamented
chairs; the rest of the suite in small covered carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
on two wheels, not unlike in appearance to our funeral hearses,
but only about half the length; and last of all <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i>,
with their attendants, closed this motley procession.</p>

<p>Though the distance was only twelve miles, it was thought
advisable by our conductors to halt for breakfast about half-way;
for, as heavy bodies move slowly, what with the delay and
confusion in first getting into order, and the frequent stoppages
on the road, we found it was eight o'clock before the whole of
the cavalcade had reached the half-way house. Here we had a
most sumptuous breakfast of roast pork and venison, rice and
made dishes, eggs, tea, milk, and a variety of fruits served up
on masses of ice.</p>

<p>The porters and the heavy baggage moved forwards without
halting; and having ended our comfortable repast, we followed
without loss of time. We had scarcely proceeded three miles,
till we found the sides of the road lined with spectators on
horseback, on foot, in small carriages similar to those we rode
in, in carts, waggons, and chairs. In the last were Chinese
ladies but, having gauze curtains at the sides and front, we
could see little of them. Several well-looking women in long
silken robes, with a great number of children, were in the small
carriages. These we understood to be Tartars. A file of soldiers
now moved along with the procession on each side of the
road, armed with whips, which they continually exercised in
order to keep off the crowd that increased as we approached
the capital, and, at length, was so great as to obstruct the road.
We observed, however, that though the soldiers were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
active and noisy in brandishing their whips, they only struck
them against the ground, and never let them fall upon the
people. Indeed a Chinese crowd is not so tumultuous and unruly
as it generally is elsewhere.</p>

<p>The excessive heat of the weather, the dustiness of the road,
the closeness of the carriages, and the slow manner in which
we moved along, would have made this short journey almost
insupportable, but from the novelty of the scene, the smiles,
the grins, the gestures of the multitude, and above all, the
momentary expectation of entering the greatest city on the surface
of the globe. Those also who had been so unlucky as to
make choice of the little covered carriages, found themselves
extremely uncomfortable, notwithstanding they are the best, the
most easy and genteel sort of carriage that the country affords.
Being fixed on the wheels without springs, and having no seats
in the inside, they are to an European, who must sit on his
haunches in the bottom, the most uneasy vehicles that can be
imagined. Father Semedo, one of the earliest missionaries to
China, asserts, that coaches were anciently in common use in
this country, and that they were laid down on account of the
great convenience and little expence of sedan chairs. The
coaches alluded to by the reverend father were, in all probability,
the little carts above mentioned, for not the vestige of any
thing better is to be found among them; not the least appearance
of any thing like a spring carriage. It is more probable
that palanquins and chairs have been in common use here and
in India, from the earliest period of their histories. The <i>lectica</i>
of the Romans is supposed to have been brought to Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the time of the Republic from some of the eastern nations.</p>

<p>The great road to the capital lay across an open country,
sandy and ill cultivated, and the few houses on each side
were of mean appearance, generally built with mud, or half
burnt bricks, to the very gates of Pekin. The middle
part of the road, for the width of eighteen or twenty feet,
was paved with stones of granite from six to sixteen feet
in length and broad in proportion. Every one of these enormous
flag stones must have been brought, at least sixty miles,
the nearest mountains where quarries of granite are found being
those that divide China from Mantchoo Tartary, near the great
wall.</p>

<p>A temple on the right of the road and a bridge of white
marble having the balustrade ornamented with figures, meant
to represent lions and other animals cut out of the same material,
were the only objects that attracted any notice, until the
walls and the lofty gates of the capital appeared in view. None
of the buildings within, on this side of the city, overtopped
the walls, though these did not appear to exceed twenty-five
or at most thirty feet in height; they were flanked with square
towers, and surrounded by a moat or ditch. These towers projected
about forty feet from the line of the wall, and were placed
at regular intervals of about seventy yards, being considered as
bow-shot distance from each other. Each had a small guard-house
upon its summit. The thickness of the base of the wall
was about twenty-five feet, and the width across this top within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the parapets twelve feet; so that the sides of the wall have a
very considerable slope, much more however within than without.
The middle part was composed of the earth that had been
dug out of the ditch; and was kept together by two retaining
walls, part of which were of brick and part of stone. The
famous barrier on the borders of Tartary, and the ramparts of
all the cities in the country, are built in the same manner.</p>

<p>No cannon were mounted on the walls nor on the bastions; but
in the high building which surmounted the gate, and which was
several stories one above the other, the port-holes were closed
with red doors, on the outside of which were painted the representations
of cannon, not unlike at a distance the sham ports
in a ship of war. The gates of a Chinese city are generally
double, and placed in the flanks of a square or semicircular bastion.
The first opens into a large space, surrounded with buildings,
which are appropriated entirely for military uses, being
the depôt of provisions and ammunition, <i>place d'armes</i>, and
barracks. Out of this place, in one of the flanks, the second
gate, having a similar high building erected over it as the first,
opens into the city.</p>

<p>The first appearance of this celebrated capital is not much calculated
to raise high expectations, nor does it in the least improve
upon a more intimate acquaintance. In approaching an
European city it generally happens that a great variety of objects
catch the eye, as the towers and spires of churches, domes,
obelisks, and other buildings for public purposes towering above
the rest; and the mind is amused in conjecturing the form, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
magnitude of their several constructions, and the uses to which
they may be applied. In Pekin not even a chimney is seen rising
above the roofs of the houses which, being all nearly of
the same height, and the streets laid out in straight lines, have
the appearance and the regularity of a large encampment. The
roofs would only require to be painted white, instead of being
red, green, or blue, to make the resemblance complete. Few
houses exceed the height of one story, and none but the great
shops have either windows or openings in the wall in front,
but most of them have a sort of terrace, with a railed balcony
or parapet wall in front, on which are placed pots of flowers,
or shrubs, or stunted trees.</p>

<p>This city is an oblong square, the outward boundary of which
is forty <i>lees</i>, each <i>lee</i> being six hundred yards, so that the inclosing
wall is near fourteen English miles, and the area about
twelve square miles, independent of the extensive suburbs at
every gate. In the south wall are three gates, and in each of the
other sides two, from whence it is sometimes called <i>The city with
nine gates</i>; but its usual name is <i>Pe-ching</i>, or the Northern
Court. The middle gate, on the south side, opens into the Imperial
city, which is a space of ground within the general inclosure,
in the shape of a parallelogram, about a mile in length
from north to south, and three-fourths of a mile from east
to west. A wall built of large red polished bricks, and
twenty feet high, covered with a roof of tiles painted yellow
and varnished, surrounds this space, in which are contained
not only the imperial palace and gardens, but also all the tribunals,
or public offices of government, lodgings for the mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>nisters,
the eunuchs, artificers, and tradesmen belonging to the
court. A great variety of surface, as well as of different objects,
appear within this inclosure. A rivulet winding through
it not only affords a plentiful supply of water, but adds largely
to the beauties of the grounds, by being formed into canals and
basons, and lakes, which, with the artificial mounts, and rocks,
and groves, exhibit the happiest imitation of nature.</p>

<p>Between the other two gates, in the south wall, and the
corresponding and opposite ones on the north side of the city,
run two streets perfectly straight, each being four English
miles in length, and about one hundred and twenty feet
in width. One street also of the same width runs from one
of the eastern to the opposite western gate, but the other is interrupted
by the north wall of the imperial city, round which
it is carried. The cross streets can be considered only as lanes
branching from these main streets at right angles; are very
narrow; but the houses in them are generally of the same construction
as those in the great streets. The large houses of the state
officers are in these lanes.</p>

<p>Although the approach to Pekin afforded little that was interesting,
we had no sooner passed the gate and opened out the
broad street, than a very singular and novel appearance was exhibited.
We saw before us a line of buildings on each side of
a wide street, consisting entirely of shops and warehouses, the
particular goods of which were brought out and displayed in
groupes in front of the houses. Before these were generally
erected large wooden pillars, whose tops were much higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
than the eves of the houses, bearing inscriptions in gilt characters,
setting forth the nature of the wares to be sold, and the
honest reputation of the seller; and, to attract the more notice,
they were generally hung with various coloured flags and
streamers and ribbands from top to bottom, exhibiting the appearance
of a line of shipping dressed, as we sometimes see
them, in the colours of all the different nations in Europe. The
sides of the houses were not less brilliant in the several colours
with which they were painted, consisting generally of sky blue
or green mixed with gold: and what appeared to us singular
enough, the articles for sale that made the greatest show were
coffins for the dead. The most splendid of our coffin furniture
would make but a poor figure if placed beside that intended for
a wealthy Chinese. These machines are seldom less than three
inches thick, and twice the bulk of ours. Next to those our
notice was attracted by the brilliant appearance of the funeral
biers and the marriage cars, both covered with ornamental
canopies.</p>

<p>At the four points where the great streets intersect one another
were erected those singular buildings, sometimes of stone,
but generally of wood, which have been called triumphal
arches, but which, in fact, are monuments to the memory of
those who had deserved well of the community, or who had attained
an unusual longevity. They consist invariably of a
large central gateway, with a smaller one on each side, all covered
with narrow roofs; and, like the houses, they are painted,
varnished, and gilt in the most splendid manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The multitude of moveable workshops of tinkers and barbers,
coblers and blacksmiths; the tents and booths where
tea and fruit, rice and other eatables were exposed for sale,
with the wares and merchandize arrayed before the doors, had
contracted this spacious street to a narrow road in the middle,
just wide enough for two of our little vehicles to pass each other.
The cavalcade of officers and soldiers that preceded the embassy,
the processions of men in office attended by their numerous retinues,
bearing umbrellas and flags, painted lanterns, and a
variety of strange insignia of their rank and station, different
trains that were accompanying, with lamentable cries, corpses
to their graves, and, with squalling music, brides to their husbands,
the troops of dromedaries laden with coals from Tartary,
the wheelbarrows and hand-carts stuffed with vegetables,
occupied nearly the whole of this middle space in one continued
line, leaving very little room for the cavalcade of the embassy
to pass. All was in motion. The sides of the street were filled
with an immense concourse of people, buying and selling and
bartering their different commodities. The buzz and confused
noises of this mixed multitude, proceeding from the loud bawling
of those who were crying their wares, the wrangling of
others, with every now and then a strange twanging noise like
the jarring of a cracked Jew's harp, the barber's signal made by
his tweezers, the mirth and the laughter that prevailed in every
groupe, could scarcely be exceeded by the brokers in the Bank
rotunda, or by the Jews and old women in <i>Rosemary-Lane</i>.
Pedlars with their packs, and jugglers, and conjurers, and fortune-tellers,
mountebanks and quack-doctors, comedians and
musicians, left no space unoccupied. The Tartar soldiers, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
their whips, kept with difficulty a clear passage for the embassy
to move slowly forwards; so slow, indeed, that although
we entered the eastern gate at half-past nine, it was near twelve
before we arrived at the western.</p>

<p>Although an extraordinary crowd might be expected to assemble
on such a particular occasion, on the same principle of
curiosity as could not fail to attract a crowd of spectators in
London, yet there was a most remarkable and a striking difference
observable between a London and a Pekin populace. In
the former the whole attention and soul of the multitude would
have been wrapt up in the novel spectacle; all would have
been idlers. In Pekin, the shew was but an accessary; every
one pursued his business, at the same time that he gratified his
curiosity. In fact, it appeared that, on every day throughout
the whole year, there was the same noise and bustle and crowd
in the capital of China. I scarcely ever passed the western gate,
which happened twice, or oftener, in the week, that I had not
to wait a considerable time before the passage was free, particularly
in the morning, notwithstanding the exertions of two or
three soldiers with their whips to clear the way. The crowd,
however, was entirely confined to the great streets, which are
the only outlets of the city. In the cross lanes all was still and
quiet.</p>

<p>Women in Pekin were commonly seen among the crowd, or
walking in the narrow streets, or riding on horseback, which
they crossed in the same manner as the men, but they were all
Tartars. They wore long silken robes, reaching down to their
feet; their shoes appeared to be as much above the common size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as those of the Chinese are under it; the upper part was generally
of embroidered satin, the sole consisted of folds of cloth or paper,
about an inch thick; they were square in front, and a
little turned up. The hair smoothed up on all sides, not very
different from that of the Chinese; and though their faces were
painted with white lead and vermillion, it was evident their
skins were much fairer than those of the former. The Chinese
women are more scrupulously confined to the house in the capital
than elsewhere. Young girls were sometimes seen smoking
their pipes in the doors of their houses, but they always
retired on the approach of men.</p>

<p>All the streets were covered with sand and dust: none had
the least pavement. The cross lanes were generally watered,
which did not appear to be the case in the main streets. A large
sheet of water, several acres in extent, within the northern wall,
affords to that part of the city, and to the palace an abundant
supply of that element, as does also a small stream which runs
along the western wall to that neighbourhood. There are besides
abundance of wells; but the water of some of these is so
dreadfully nauseous, that we, who were unaccustomed to it,
were under the necessity of sending to a distance to obtain such
as was free from mineral or earthy impregnations. When mixed
with tea, the well water was particularly disgusting.</p>

<p>Although Pekin cannot boast, like ancient Rome, or modern
London, of the conveniences of common sewers to carry off
the dirt and dregs that must necessarily accumulate in large
cities, yet it enjoys one important advantage, which is rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
found in capitals out of England: no kind of filth or nastiness,
creating offensive smells is thrown out into the streets, a piece of
cleanliness that perhaps may be attributed rather to the scarcity
and value of manure, than to the exertions of the police officers.
Each family has a large earthen jar, into which is carefully
collected every thing that may be used as manure; when the
jar is full, there is no difficulty of converting its contents into
money, or of exchanging them for vegetables. The same
small boxed carts with one wheel, which supply the city with
vegetables, invariably return to the gardens with a load of this
liquid manure. Between the palace of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> and Pekin,
I have met many hundreds of these carts. They are generally
dragged by one person, and pushed on by another; and
they leave upon the road an odour that continues without intermission
for many miles. Thus, though the city is cleared of
its filth, it seldom loses its fragrance. In fact, a constant disgusting
odour remains in and about all the houses the whole
day long, from the fermentation of the heterogeneous mixtures
kept above ground, which in our great cities are carried off in
drains.</p>

<p>The medical gentlemen of China are not quite so ingenious,
as we are told the faculty in Madrid were about the middle of
the last century, when the inhabitants were directed, by royal
proclamation, to build proper places of retirement to their
houses, instead of emptying their nocturnal machines out of
the windows into the streets. The inhabitants took it into
their heads to consider this order as a great affront, and a direct
violation of the rights of man; but the doctors were the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
strenuous opposers of the measure, having no doubt very
cogent reasons for wishing the continuance of the practice.
They assured the inhabitants, that if human excrement was no
longer to be accumulated in the streets, to attract the putrescent
particles floating in the air, they would find their way into
the human body, and a pestilential sickness would be the inevitable
consequence.</p>

<p>The police of the capital, as we afterwards found, is so well regulated,
that the safety and tranquillity of the inhabitants are
seldom disturbed. At the end of every cross street, and at certain
distances in it, are a kind of cross bars, with sentry boxes
at each of which is placed a soldier, and few of these streets are
without a guard-house. Besides, the proprietor or inhabitant
of every tenth house, like the ancient tythingmen of England,
takes it in turn to keep the peace, and be responsible for the
good conduct of his nine neighbours. If any riotous company
should assemble, or any disturbances happen within his district,
he is to give immediate information thereof to the nearest guard-house.
The soldiers also go their rounds and instead of crying
the hour like our watchmen, strike upon a short tube of bamboo,
which gives a dull hollow sound, that for several nights
prevented us from sleeping until we were accustomed to it.</p>

<p>It took us full two hours, as I before observed, in passing
from the eastern to the western gate of Pekin. The clouds of
dust raised by the populace were here much denser than on the
road, and the smothering heat of the day, the thermometer in
our little carts standing at 96°, was almost insupportable. Except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the great crowd on every side, we saw little to engage the attention
after the first five minutes. Indeed, a single walk
through one of the broad streets is quite sufficient to give a
stranger a competent idea of the whole city. He will immediately
perceive that every street is laid out in the same manner,
and every house built upon the same plan; and that their architecture
is void of taste, grandeur, beauty, solidity, or convenience;
that the houses are merely tents, and that there is nothing
magnificent, even in the palace of the Emperor;&mdash;but
we shall have occasion to speak on this subject hereafter. Ask
a Chinese, however, what is to be seen that is curious or great
in the capital, and he will immediately enter upon a long
history of the beauties of the palace belonging to <i>Ta-whang-tee</i>,
the mighty Emperor. According to his notions, every thing
within the palace walls is gold and silver. He will tell you of
gold and silver pillars, gold and silver roofs, gold and silver
vases, in which are swimming gold and silver fishes. All, however,
is not gold that glitters in China, more than elsewhere.
The Emperor, as I shall hereafter have occasion to notice, has
very little surplus revenue at his disposal, and is frequently
distressed for money to pay his army and other exigences of the
state. And, though China has of late years drawn from Europe
a considerable quantity of specie, yet when this is scattered over
so vast an extent of country, and divided among so many millions
of people, it becomes almost as a drop thrown into the sea. Most
of the money, besides, that enters China is melted down, and
converted into articles of luxury or convenience. Few nations
are better acquainted with the value of these precious metals
than the Chinese; and few, if any, can surpass their in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>genuity
in drawing out the one into thin leaves, and the other
into the finest wire.</p>

<p>We were not a little overjoyed in finding ourselves once
more upon the flagged causeway, and in an open country, after
passing a small suburb beyond the western gate of the city.
They brought us to a villa which was a kind of appendage to
one of the Emperor's palaces, about eight miles beyond Pekin.
The buildings, consisting of a number of small detached apartments,
straggling over a surface of ground, about fifteen acres in extent,
were neither sufficiently numerous to lodge the suite, nor to contain
the presents and our baggage; and were moreover so miserably
out of repair and in so ruinous a condition, that the greater part
was wholly uninhabitable. The officers were accordingly told
that these were not accommodations suitable to the dignity of a
British Embassador, and that he would not on any consideration
put up with them; that it was a matter of indifference whether
he was lodged in the city or the country, but that the lodgings
should be convenient and proper. The superintending officers,
upon this, caused a large temporary building to be erected
with poles and mats, which, as by magic, was finished in the
course of the night, hoping, by this exertion, to have removed
all objections to the place. His Lordship, however, being determined
not to remain where there was neither a decent room,
nor any kind of comfort or convenience, every building being
entirely unfurnished, and, as I said before, the greater number
untenantable, insisted upon being removed to Pekin, where accordingly
it was very soon announced there was a suitable house
ready for his reception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>On returning to the capital we passed through the great street
of a town called <i>Hai-tien</i> in which most of the houses were of
two stories, and before the upper of which was a kind of Véranda
full of dwarf trees and flower-pots. A great proportion
of the houses were either butchers' shops or coffin-makers.
From the end of this street was a most extensive view of Pekin
and the surrounding country. The eye from hence took in
the whole length of the high straight wall with its two lofty
gates and numerous square towers. At each angle of the wall
is a large square building rising above the parapet to four heights
or stories of port-holes, and covered with two roofs. In each
row of the four fronts are fourteen windows or port-holes.
These I understood to be the rice magazines or public granaries.
Near the north-west angle is a tall pagoda, another high tower
not unlike a glass-house, and towards the higher western gate
appeared the upper part of a pyramidal building that terminated
in a gilded flame, very like the summit of our <a name="Monument" id="Monument"></a>Monument under
which, instead of a gallery, was a most magnificent canopy or
umbrella, painted and gilt with such brilliant colours, that from
certain points of view, when the rays of the sun played upon it,
the glittering appearance had a very good effect. It was said to
be a temple, and seemed to be of the same kind of architecture as
the <i>Shoo-ma-doo</i> described by Col. Symes in his embassy to Ava.</p>

<p>We found our new lodging sufficiently large, but the apartments
were shamefully dirty, having been uninhabited for some time;
very much out of repair, and totally unfurnished. This house,
being considered be one of the best in the whole city, I shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
occasion to take notice of hereafter, in speaking of the state
of their architecture. It was built by the late <i>Ho-poo</i>, or Collector
of the customs at Canton, from which situation he was
preferred to the collectorship of salt duties at <i>Tien-sing</i>, where, it
seems, he was detected in embezzling the public revenues, thrown
into jail, and his immense property confiscated to the crown. The
officers appointed to attend the embassy told us, that when it
was proposed to the Emperor for the English Embassador to occupy
this house, he immediately replied, "Most certainly, you
cannot refuse the temporary occupation of a house to the
Embassador of that nation which contributed so very amply
towards the expense of building it." The inference to be
drawn from such a remark, is, that the court of Pekin is well
aware of the extortions committed against foreigners at Canton.</p>

<p>The Emperor being at this time in Tartary, where he meant to
celebrate the festival of the anniversary of his birth-day, had given
orders that the public introduction of the British Embassador
should be fixed for that day, and should take place at Gehol, a
small town 136 miles from Pekin, where he had a large palace,
park, gardens, and a magnificent <i>Poo-ta-la</i> or temple of Budha.
Accordingly a selection was made of such presents as were the
most portable, to be sent forwards into Tartary; and the Embassador,
with part of his suite, several officers of the court, and
their retinue, set out from Pekin on the second of September.
Some of the gentlemen, with part of the guard and of the
servants, remained in Pekin, and Dr. Dinwiddie and myself,
with two mechanics, had apartments allotted to us in the
palace of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, where the largest and most va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>luable
of the presents were to be fitted up for the inspection of
the old Emperor on his return from Tartary.</p>

<p>Having already acquired some little knowledge of the language
on the passage from England, by the assistance of two
Chinese priests who had been sent by their superiors to Naples,
for the purpose of being instructed in the Christian religion, I
hoped to find this temporary banishment less irksome, particularly
as I had previously stipulated with the officers belonging to that
palace for an unconditional leave to visit the capital whenever I
should find it necessary or proper, during the absence of the
Embassador; and, it is but fair to say, they kept faith to their
engagement in the strictest sense. A horse and one of the little
covered carts were always at my disposal.</p>

<p>The gentlemen left in the city were less agreeably situated. At
the outer gate of their lodgings a guard was stationed with orders
to allow none of them to pass, and all their proceedings and
movements were closely watched. Sometimes they were a little
relieved by occasional visits from the European missionaries;
but so suspicious were the officers of government of any communication
with these gentlemen that they were invariably accompanied
by some of them to act as spies, notwithstanding
they could not comprehend one single word that was exchanged
in the conversations they held together. A Chinese has no
knowledge whatsoever of any of the European languages. But
he watches the actions, and even the motions of the eye, and
makes his report accordingly. The courts of the house were
constantly filled with the inferior officers of government and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
their servants, all of whom had some post or other assigned to
them connected with the British Embassy. One was the superintendant
of the kitchen, another furnished tea, one was appointed
to supply us with fruit, another with vegetables, and
another with milk.</p>

<p>During the time I should be required to reside in <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>,
I particularly wished to have none other than Chinese servants,
that I might be under the necessity of extending the little
knowledge I had already acquired of the spoken language. This
is by no means difficult to learn except in the nice intonations
or inflexions of voice, but the written character is, perhaps of
all others, the most abstruse and most perplexing both to the
eye and to the memory. The length of time that is usually
required by the Chinese, together with the intense study and
stretch of the memory which they find necessary in order to obtain
a very small proportion of the characters that form the language,
are serious obstructions to the progress of the arts and
sciences, but favourable to the stability of the government of
which indeed the language may be considered as one of the
great bulwarks. But the observations I have to make on this
subject will more properly be reserved for a separate chapter.</p>

<p>On arriving at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> I found a number of Chinese
workmen busily employed in breaking open the packages, some
in one place and some in another, to the no little danger of the
globes, clocks, glass lustres, and such like frangible articles, many
of which must inevitably have suffered under less careful and dexterous
hands than those of the Chinese. As it was intended they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
should be placed in one large room, the great hall in which the
Emperor gives audience to his ministers, the first operation
was to move them all thither, and carefully to unpack them;
and we had the satisfaction to find that not a single article was
either missing or injured.</p>

<p>We had not been long here, before a gentleman appeared
who, notwithstanding his Chinese dress, I soon perceived to
be an European. He introduced himself by saying, in the
Latin language, that his name was Deodato a Neapolitan
missionary, and that the court had appointed him to act as interpreter,
hoped he might be useful to us, and offered his services
in the most handsome manner; and, I have great pleasure in
availing myself of this opportunity to acknowledge the friendly
and unremitting attention I received from him during a residence
of five weeks in this palace, and the very material assistance
he afforded in explaining the nature, value, and use of the
several pieces of machinery to those Chinese who were appointed
to superintend them. Signor Deodato was an excellent
mechanic; and in this capacity was employed in the palace to
inspect and keep in order the numberless pieces of clock-work
that had found their way thither, chiefly from London.</p>

<p>The officer appointed to attend us wore a light blue button
in his cap, denoting the 4th degree of rank. When he shewed
the apartments that were designed for us, I could not forbear observing
to him, that they seemed fitter for hogs than for human
creatures, and that rather than be obliged to occupy those, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
other like them, I should for my own part prefer coming down
from the capital every morning, and return in the evening. They
consisted of three or four hovels in a small court, surrounded
with a wall as high as their roofs. Each room was about twelve
feet square, the walls completely naked, the ceiling broken in,
the rushes or stems of <i>boleus</i>, that held the plaister, hanging
down and strewed on the floor; the lattice work of the windows
partially covered with broken paper; the doors consisting
of old bamboo skreens; the floor covered with dust, and there
was not the least furniture in any of them, except an old table
and two or three chairs in the one which was intended, I suppose,
for the dining-room. The rest had nothing in them whatsoever
but a little raised platform of brick-work, which they told us
was to sleep on, and that they should cover it with mats, and
order proper bedding to be brought upon it. Yet these miserable
hovels were not only within the palace wall, but scarcely
two hundred yards from the great hall of audience. The
officer assured us that they were the apartments of one of their
<i>Ta-gin</i> (great men) but that, as I did not seem to like them,
we should be accommodated with others. We were then
carried a little farther, where there was a number of buildings
upon a more extensive scale enclosed also by high walls.
The apartments were somewhat larger, but miserably dirty both
within and without, and wholly unfurnished; but as our attendant
took care to tell us they belonged to one of the <i>ministers
of state</i>, and that he lodged in them when the Emperor was at
Yuen-min-yuen, we were precluded from further complaint.
Had we refused those that were considered sufficient for
a minister of state, the man might have thought that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
less than the Emperor's own would have satisfied us. If the
menial servants of his Britannic Majesty's Ministers were no
better lodged than the ministers themselves of his Chinese Majesty,
they would be apt to think themselves very ill used. We
accepted them, however, such as they were, and caused them to
be swept out, an operation which had not been performed for
many months before; a table and chairs were brought in, with
mats, pillows, and silken mattresses; but for these we had no
occasion, having fortunately brought with us from the ships
our own cots.</p>

<p>To make amends for our uncomfortable lodging, we sat down
to a most excellent dinner, wholly prepared in the Chinese style,
consisting of a vast variety of made dishes very neatly dressed,
and served in porcelain bowls. The best soup I ever tasted in
any part of the world was made here from an extract of beef,
seasoned with a preparation of soy and other ingredients. Their
vermicelli is excellent, and all their pastry is unusually light
and white as snow. We understood it to be made from the buck
wheat. The luxury of ice, in the neighbourhood of the capital,
is within the reach of the poorest peasant; and, although they
drink their tea and other beverage warm, they prefer all kinds of
fruit when cooled on ice.</p>

<p>The three first days, while the articles were unpacking and
assorting, we remained tolerably quiet, being annoyed only
with the interference and inquisitiveness of an old eunuch, who
had in his train about a dozen of the same kind <i>simile aut secundum</i>.
But no sooner were they taken out of their cases, and set up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the room, than visitors of all ranks, from princes of the blood
to plain citizens, came daily to look at the presents, but more
particularly at us, whom I believe they considered by much the
greatest curiosities. All the men of letters and rank, who held
employments in the state, and whose attendance had been dispensed
with at Gehol, flocked to <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>.</p>

<p>Among the numerous visitors came one day in great state
the president of a board in Pekin, on which the Jesuits have
conferred the pompous but unmerited title of the <i>Tribunal of
Mathematics</i>. He was accompanied by a Portuguese missionary
of the name of <i>Govea</i>, who is the titular Bishop of Pekin, Padre
Antonio, and his secretary, both Portuguese, and all three
members of the said tribunal. The particular object of their
visit was to make themselves fully acquainted with the nature
and use of the several presents that related to science, and especially
of the large planetarium, which had already made a great
noise in China, in order that they might be able to give a proper
description and explanation to his Imperial Majesty, both
of this instrument, and of all the others connected with their
department, and to answer any question concerning them that
might be asked.</p>

<p>It created no sort of surprize to any of us, on finding that the
Chinese who accompanied these reverend gentlemen were
completely ignorant of the nature of a complicated machine,
whose motions, regulated by the most ingenious mechanism
that had ever been constructed in Europe, represented all those
even of the most irregular and eccentric of the heavenly bodies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
nor in perceiving that they seemed to be rather disappointed in
the appearance and operations of this instrument. It was obvious,
from the few questions put by the president of this learned
body, that he had conceived the planetarium to be something
similar to one of those curious pieces of musical mechanism
which, in the Canton jargon, are called <i>Sing-songs</i>, and that
nothing more was necessary than to wind it up like a jack,
when it would immediately spin round, and tell him every thing
that he wanted to know.</p>

<p>But the difficulty of making the right reverend Bishop and
his colleagues comprehend the principles upon which it was
constructed, and the several phenomena of the heavenly bodies
exhibited by it, conveyed almost as bad an opinion of their astronomical
and mathematical knowledge as of that of their president.
The prelate, however, appeared to be a man of mild and placid
temper, pleasing manners, and of a modest and unassuming
deportment. His secretary was a keen sharp fellow, extremely
inquisitive, and resolved not to lose the little knowledge he
might acquire, for he wrote down the answer to every question
that was proposed.</p>

<p>The following day the Bishop came unattended by the Chinese
part of their board, and gave us some account of the nature of
their employ. The astronomical part of the national almanack,
such as calculating eclipses, the times of new and full moon,
the rising and setting of the sun, were, as he informed us,
entrusted to him and his colleagues, but the astrological part was
managed by a committee of the Chinese members. He candidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
avowed that neither he nor any of his European brethren were
well qualified for the task, and that they had been hitherto
more indebted to the <i>Connoissances de tems</i> of Paris than to their
own calculations. That having exactly ascertained the difference
of meridians between Pekin and Paris, they had little difficulty
in reducing the calculations made for the latter, so as to
answer for the situation of the former, at least to a degree of
accuracy that was sufficiently near the truth not to be detected
by any of the Chinese members.</p>

<p>The French revolution having put an end to future communications
with that country was to them a severe blow in this
respect, though the secretary thought he could now manage the
calculation of an eclipse sufficiently correct to pass current with
the Chinese. Fortunately, however, Doctor Dinwiddie had
provided himself on leaving London with a set of the nautical
almanacks, calculated for the meridian of Greenwich, up to
the year 1800, which they considered as an invaluable present.</p>

<p>The grandsons of the Emperor were almost daily visitors. It
seems there is a kind of college in the palace for their education.
Though young men from the ages of sixteen to five-and-twenty,
the old eunuch used frequently to push them by the shoulders
out of the hall of audience; and, on expressing my surprise
to Deodato at such insolence, he informed me that he was their
<i>aya</i>, their governor!</p>

<p>We had also a great number of Tartar generals and military
officers who had heard of sword-blades that would cut iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
bars without injuring the edge; and so great was their astonishment
on proving the fact, that they could scarcely credit the
evidence of their own eyes. We could not confer a more acceptable
present on a military officer than one of Gill's sword-blades;
and from the eager applications made for them, as we
passed through the country, the introduction of them through
Canton, in the regular course of trade, would, I should suppose,
be no difficult task.</p>

<p>But the two elegant carriages made by Hatchett puzzled the
Chinese more than any of the other presents. Nothing of the
kind had ever been seen at the capital; and the disputes among
themselves as to the part which was intended for the seat of the
Emperor were whimsical enough. The hammer-cloth that covered
the box of the winter carriage had a smart edging, and
was ornamented with festoons of roses. Its splendid appearance
and elevated situation determined it at once, in the opinion of
the majority, to be the Emperor's seat; but a difficulty arose
how to appropriate the inside of the carriage. They examined
the windows, the blinds, and the screens, and at last concluded,
that it could be for nobody but his ladies. The old eunuch
came to me for information, and when he learned that the fine
elevated box was to be the seat of the man who managed the
horses, and that the Emperor's place was within, he asked me,
with a sneer, if I supposed the <i>Ta-whang-tee</i> would suffer any
man to sit higher than himself, and to turn his back towards
him? and he wished to know if we could not contrive to have
the coach-box removed and placed somewhere behind the body
of the carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance, not easily to be accounted for,
occurred in opening a cask of Birmingham hardware. Every
one knows the necessity of excluding the sea-air as much as
possible from highly polished articles of iron and steel, and accordingly
all such articles intended to be sent abroad are packed
with the greatest care. The casks, or cases, are made as tight
as possible and covered with pitched canvas. Such was the
cask in question. Yet, when the head was taken off, and a few
of the packages removed, an enormous large scorpion was
found in the midst of the cask, nearly in a torpid state, but it
quickly recovered on exposure to the warm air.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Among the presents carried into Tartary was a collection of
prints, chiefly portraits of English nobility and distinguished
persons; and to make the present more acceptable, they were
bound up in three volumes in yellow Morocco. The Emperor
was so pleased with this collection, that he sent it express to
<i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> to have the name, rank, and office of each portrait
translated into the Mantchoo and Chinese languages. The
Tartar writer got on pretty well, but the Chinese secretary was
not a little puzzled with the B, the D, and the R, that so frequently
recurred in the English names. The Duke of Marlborough
was <i>Too-ke Ma-ul-po-loo</i>, and Bedford was transformed
to <i>Pe-te-fo-ul-te</i>. But here a more serious difficulty occurred than
that of writing the name. The rank was also to be written
down, and on coming to the portrait of this nobleman, (which
was a proof impression of the print, engraved from a picture by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Sir Joshua Reynolds, when the late Duke of Bedford was a
youth,) I told the Chinese to write him down a <i>Ta-gin</i>, or great
man of the second order. He instantly observed that I surely
meant his father was a <i>Ta-gin</i>. I then explained to him that,
according to our laws, the son succeeded to the rank of the father,
and that with us it was by no means necessary, in order
to obtain the first rank in the country, that a man should be of
a certain age, be possessed of superior talents, or suitable qualifications.
That these were sometimes conducive to high honours,
yet that a great part of the legislative body of the nation
were entitled to their rank and situation by birth. They
laughed heartily at the idea of a man being born a legislator,
when it required so many years of close application to enable
one of their countrymen to pass his examination for the very
lowest order of state-officers. As, however, the descendants of
Confucius continue to enjoy a sort of nominal rank, and as
their Emperor can also confer an hereditary dignity, without
entitling to office, emolument, or exclusive privilege, they
considered his Grace might be one of this description, and
wrote down his rank accordingly; but they positively refused to
give him the title of <i>Ta-gin</i>, or great man, asking me, if I
thought their Emperor was so stupid as not to know the impossibility
of a little boy having attained the rank of a <i>great man</i>.</p>

<p>About the 14th of September, or three days before the Emperor's
birth-day, <i>Padre Anselmo</i>, the procurator for the mission
<i>de propaganda fide</i>, delivered me letters from Macao for the Embassador,
which the Chinese refused to send to Gehol, though
daily expresses went to and from that place. <i>Anselmo</i> hinted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
me that the late viceroy of Canton, who was no friend to the
English, had arrived, and that he feared all was not right. That
the Tartar legate had been degraded from his rank for deceiving
the Emperor, and particularly for not paying his personal respects
to the Embassador on board his ship when in <i>Tien-sing</i>
roads. That the peacock's feather, which he wore in his cap
as a mark of his master's favour, was exchanged for a crow's
tail, the sign of great disgrace, and that the consideration of
his age and his family had alone saved him from banishment.
The Emperor, it seems, having heard that the Embassador had
his picture in his cabin on board the Lion, asked the legate
whether it was like him, upon which it came out that he had
never been near the Lion, as his orders directed him.</p>

<p>On the 17th, being the Emperor's birth-day, all the princes
and officers about the palace assembled in their robes of ceremony,
to make their obeisance to the throne in the great
hall of audience. On this occasion were placed on the floor
before the throne, on three small tripods, a cup of tea, of oil,
and of rice, perhaps as an acknowledgment of the Emperor being
the proprietary of the soil, of which these are three material
products. The old eunuch told me that I might remain in
the hall during the ceremony, if I would consent to perform it
with them, and offered to instruct me in it. He said that all
the officers of government, in every part of the empire, made
their prostrations to the name of the Emperor inscribed on yellow
silk on that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days after this, on going as usual in the morning to the hall
of audience, I found the doors shut and the old eunuch, who kept
the keys, walking about in so sullen a mood that I could not get
from him a single word. Different groupes of officers were assembled
in the court-yard, all looking as if something very dreadful
either had occurred, or was about to happen. Nobody would
speak to me, nor could I get the least explanation of this extraordinary
conduct, till at length our friend Deodato appeared with
a countenance no less woeful than those of the officers of government,
and the old eunuch. I asked him what was the matter?
His answer was, We are all lost, ruined, and undone! He
then informed me that intelligence had arrived from Gehol,
stating, that Lord Macartney had refused to comply with the
ceremony of prostrating himself, like the Embassadors of tributary
princes, nine times before the Emperor, unless one of
equal rank with himself should go through the same ceremony
before the portrait of his Britannic Majesty: that rather than
do this they had accepted his offer to perform the same ceremony
of respect to the Emperor as to his own sovereign.
That although little was thought of this affair at Gehol, the
great officers of state in the tribunal or department of ceremonies
in Pekin were mortified, and perplexed, and alarmed; and
that, in short, it was impossible to say what might be the consequence
of an event unprecedented in the annals of the empire.
That the Emperor, when he began to think more seriously on the
subject, might possibly impeach those before the criminal tribunal
who had advised him to accede to such a proposal, on reflecting
how much his dignity had suffered by the compliance;
and that the records of the country might hand it down to pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>terity,
as an event that had tarnished the lustre of his reign, being
nothing short of breaking through an ancient custom, and
adopting one of a barbarous nation in its place. Deodato
thought even that its ill effects might extend to them, as Europeans,
and might injure the cause which was the first object of
their mission.</p>

<p>I found it in vain to put into good humour that day either
the officers of government, or the eunuchs, or even the missionaries;
and our table was very materially affected by it, both
in the number and the quality of dishes;&mdash;a criterion from
which, more than any other, a judgment may be formed of
the state of mind in which a Chinese happens to be. Something
of the same kind, it seems, occurred at Gehol. From
the time the Embassador began to make conditions, his table
was abridged, under an idea that he might be starved into an
unconditional compliance. Finding this experiment fail, they
had recourse to a different conduct, and became all kindness and
complaisance.</p>

<p>The ill-humour occasioned by the news from Gehol gradually
wore off, but I observed that the princes who had hitherto
been daily visitors now kept entirely away; and the old eunuch,
when put out of his way, used to apply to us the epithet of
proud, headstrong Englishmen.</p>

<p>On the 26th the Embassador (during whose stay at Gehol
in Tartary an account of all that passed there is given in Sir
George Staunton's book) returned to Pekin, when the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>mainder
of the presents were sent to Yuen-min-yuen. A number
of Tartar princes and great officers of state came to look
at those fitted up in the hall of audience, and seemed extremely
solicitous that the whole should be got ready without delay.
Notice was also given that, on the 30th the Emperor would
inspect the presents. This was the day fixed for his return,
and it was notified to the Embassador that it was an usual
compliment for all public officers to meet him on the road, at
the distance of ten or twelve miles from the capital. Accordingly,
about four o'clock in the morning of the 30th, we were
all mounted and arrived at our ground about six. The whole
road had been newly made, rolled as level as a bowling-green,
watered to keep down the dust and, on each side, at the distance
of about fifty yards from each other, were small triangular
poles erected, from which were suspended painted lanterns.</p>

<p>They brought us into a kind of guard-house, where tea and
other refreshments were prepared, after which we took our station
on a high bank on the left of the road. On each side, as
far as the eye could reach, were several thousands of the great
officers of state in their habits of ceremony; Tartar troops in
their holiday dresses; standard-bearers without number, military
music, and officers of the household, lining the two sides
of the road. The approach of the Emperor was announced by
a blast of the trumpet, followed by softer music, "and at that
time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flutes,
harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, then the
princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers,
the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
provinces, that were gathered together, fell down and worshipped,"
except certain strangers, who, being obstinately
resolved to do no greater homage to any sovereign than what is
required by their own sovereign, bent one knee only to the
ground.</p>

<p>The Emperor was carried by eight men in a kind of sedan
chair, which was followed by a clumsy state chariot upon two
wheels, and without springs. He bowed very graciously to the
Embassador as he passed, and sent a message to him to say that,
understanding he was not well, he advised him to return immediately
to Pekin, and not to stop at Yuen-min-yuen, as was
intended.</p>

<p>The morning being very cold, we were desirous to get home
as fast as we could; and accordingly galloped along with some of
the Tartar cavalry. When we arrived under the walls of Pekin,
we turned our horses towards a different gate to that through
which we were accustomed to pass, in order to see a little
more of the city. But one of our conductors, who had
thought it his duty not to lose sight of us, in perceiving us
making a wrong turn, hallowed out with all his might. We
pushed forward, however, and got through the gate, but we
were pursued with such a hue and cry, that we were glad to
escape through one of the cross streets leading to our hotel,
where we arrived with at least a hundred soldiers at our
heels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st of October the Emperor, attended by a Tartar,
inspected the presents in the hall of audience and examined
them with minute attention. He desired the Tartar prince to
tell us, through Deodato, that the accounts he had received
of our good conduct at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> gave him great pleasure,
and that he had ordered a present to be made to each of us, as
a proof of his entire satisfaction. This present was brought,
after his departure from the hall, by the old eunuch, who took
care to tell us that before we received it we must make nine
prostrations according to the Chinese custom. I made him no
answer, but requested Deodato to explain to the Tartar prince,
who was still present, that being under the orders of the Embassador
we did not think ourselves authorized to do what he
had found good to refuse, but that we had not the least objection
to go through the same ceremony that he had done at Gehol.
The Tartar prince immediately answered that nothing further
was required. We accordingly placed one knee on the lowest
step leading to the throne. The present consisted of rolls
of silk and several pieces of silver cast in the form of a
Tartar shoe, without any mark or inscription on them, and each
about the weight of an ounce.</p>

<p>The presents being now all delivered, and the Embassador
informed by the missionaries that preparations were making for
our departure, the usual time being nearly expired, his Excellency
was desirous of having the day fixed, and for this purpose
dispatched a note to the first minister, who sent an answer
by the Tartar legate to inform him that, to prevent any
likelihood of being surprized by the approaching bad weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Emperor had named the 7th instant for the beginning of
our journey; and had given orders that every honour and distinction
should be paid to the Embassy on the road.</p>

<p>But before I quit these renowned gardens of Yuen-min-yuen,
it will naturally be expected I should say something on their subject.
From all that I had heard and read of the grandeur and
beauty of the scenery and the magnificence of <a name="the" id="the"></a>the palaces, I had
certainly expected to meet with a style of gardening and laying
out of grounds superior, or at least equal, to any thing in the
same line in Europe; and, perhaps indeed, I might have been
fully gratified in all my expectation provided no restraint had
been thrown upon our walks, which was far from being the
case. All the little excursions I made were by stealth. Even
in the short distance between the hall of audience and our lodgings,
which might be about three hundred paces, we were continually
watched. The idea of being stopped by an eunuch or
some of the inferior officers belonging to the court, was sufficient
to put us on our guard against meeting with any such mortification;
pride, in such circumstances, generally gets the better
of the desire, however strong, of gratifying curiosity. I sometimes,
however, ventured to stroll from our lodging in the evening
in order to take a stolen glance at these celebrated gardens.</p>

<p>The grounds of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> are calculated to comprehend
an extent of at least ten English miles in diameter, or about
sixty thousand acres, a great part of which, however, is wastes
and woodland. The general appearance of those parts near
where we lodged, as to the natural surface of the country, bro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>ken
into hill and dale, and diversified with wood and lawn,
may be compared with Richmond park, to which, however, they
add the very great advantage of abundance of canals, rivers, and
large sheets of water, whose banks, although artificial, are neither
trimmed, nor shorn, nor sloped, like the glacis of a fortification,
but have been thrown up with immense labour in an irregular,
and, as it were, fortuitous manner, so as to represent the free
hand of nature. Bold rocky promontories are seen jutting into
a lake, and vallies retiring, some choaked with wood, others
in a state of high cultivation. In particular spots where pleasure-houses,
or places of rest or retirement, were erected, the
views appeared to have been studied. The trees were not only
placed according to their magnitudes, but the tints of their
foliage seemed also to have been considered in the composition
of the picture, which some of the landscapes might be called
with great propriety. But, if an opinion may be formed from
those parts of them which I have seen, and I understood there
is a great similarity throughout the whole, they fall very short
of the fanciful and extravagant descriptions that Sir William
Chambers has given of Chinese gardening. Much, however,
has been done, and nothing that I saw could be considered as
an offence to nature.</p>

<p>Thirty distinct places of residence for the Emperor, with all the
necessary appendages of building to each, for lodging the several
officers of state, who are required to be present on court
days and particular occasions, for the eunuchs, servants, and
artificers, each composing a village of no inconsiderable magnitude,
are said to be contained within the inclosure of these gar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>dens.
These assemblages of buildings, which they dignify with
the name of palaces, are, however, of such a nature as to be
more remarkable for their number than for their splendour
or magnificence. A great proportion of the buildings consists
in mean cottages. The very dwelling of the Emperor and the
grand hall in which he gives audience, when divested of the gilding
and the gaudy colours with which they are daubed, are
little superior, and much less solid, than the barns of a substantial
English farmer. Their apartments are as deficient in
proportion, as their construction is void of every rule and principle
which we are apt to consider as essential to architecture.
The principal hall of audience at Yuen-min-yuen stood upon a
platform of granite, raised about four feet above the level of the
court. A row of large wooden columns surrounding the building
supported the projecting roof; and a second row within
the first, and corresponding with it (the interstices between
the columns being filled up with brick-work to the height of
about four feet) served for the walls of the room. The upper
part of these walls was a kind of lattice-work, covered over
with large sheets of oiled paper, and was capable of being
thrown entirely open on public occasions. The wooden columns
had no capitals, and the only architrave was the horizontal
beam that supported the rafters of the roof. This, in
direct contradiction to the established mode in European architecture,
was the uppermost member of what might be called
the entablature or frize, which was a broad skreen of wood,
fastened between the upper part of the columns, painted with
the most vivid colours of blue, red, and green, and interlarded
with gilding; and the whole had net-work of wire stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
over it, to prevent its being defiled by swallows, and other
birds frequenting human dwellings. The length of this room
within was one hundred and ten feet, breadth forty-two, and
height twenty feet: the ceiling painted with circles, squares, and
polygons, whimsically disposed, and loaded with a great variety
of colours. The floor was paved with grey marble flag stones
laid chequer-wise. The throne, placed in a recess, was supported
by rows of pillars painted red like those without. It
consisted entirely of wood, not unlike mahogany, the carving
of which was exquisitely fine. The only furniture was a pair
of brass kettle-drums, two large paintings, two pair of ancient
blue porcelain vases, a few volumes of manuscripts, and a table
at one end of the room on which was placed an old English
chiming clock, made in the seventeenth century by one Clarke
of Leadenhall-street, and which our old friend the eunuch had
the impudence to tell us was the workmanship of a Chinese. A
pair of circular fans made of the wing feathers of the Argus
pheasant, and mounted on long polished ebony poles stood, one
on each side of the throne, over which was written in four characters,
"true, great, refulgent, splendor;" and under these,
in a lozenge, the character of <i>Happiness</i>. In the different courts
were several miserable attempts at sculpture, and some bronze
figures, but all the objects were fanciful, distorted, and entirely
out of nature. The only specimen of workmanship about the
palace, that would bear a close examination, besides the carving
of the throne, was a brick wall enclosing the flower garden,
which, perhaps, in no respect is exceeded by any thing of
the sort in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the architecture and gardening of the Chinese,
it may be expected that I should give a more detailed description,
or offer some opinion on those subjects. The little I
have to say on the former will be reserved for another place;
and, with respect to the latter, I regret that I had not an opportunity
of seeing so much as I could have wished, and particularly
the Emperor's great park at Gehol, which, from the description
of the Embassador, seemed to be almost unrivalled for
its features of beauty, sublimity, and amenity. But my own
deficiency will be amply filled up with an extract or two from
the Journal of his Lordship, whose taste and skill in landscape
gardening are so well known. I have indeed much to regret
that I could not enrich the present work with more extracts
from it, but as it makes a complete picture of itself the partial
selection of detached parts might have been injurious to it, by
conveying wrong impressions, when unconnected with the rest.
I am, therefore, the more obliged (and gladly embrace this opportunity
of expressing the obligations I feel) to his Lordship, for
what little he has allowed me to transcribe.</p>

<p>Speaking of the route from Pekin to Gehol in Tartary, Lord
Macartney observes: "Our journey, upon the whole, has been
very pleasant and, being divided into seven days, not at all
fatiguing. At the end of every stage we have been lodged
and entertained in the wings or houses adjoining to the Emperor's
palaces. These palaces, which occur at short distances
from each other on the road, have been built for his
reception, on his annual visit to Tartary. They are constructed
upon nearly the same plan and in the same taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
They front the south, and are usually situated on irregular
ground near the basis of gentle hills which, together with
<a name="their" id="their"></a>their adjoining vallies, are enclosed by high walls and laid
out in parks and pleasure grounds, with every possible attention
to picturesque beauty. Whenever water can be brought
into the view it is not neglected; the distant hills are planted,
cultivated, or left naked, according to their accompaniments
in the prospect. The wall is often concealed in a sunk fence,
in order to give an idea of greater extent. A Chinese gardener
is the painter of nature, and though totally ignorant of
perspective, as a science, produces the happiest effects by the
management, or rather pencilling, of distances, if I may use
the expression, by relieving or keeping down the features
of the scene, by contrasting trees of a bright with those of a
dusky foliage, by bringing them forward, or throwing them
back, according to their bulk and their figure, and by introducing
buildings of different dimensions, either heightened by
strong colouring, or softened by simplicity and omission of
ornament.</p>

<p>"The Emperor having been informed that, in the course of
our travels in China we had shewn a strong desire of seeing
every thing curious and interesting, was pleased to give directions
to the first minister to shew us his park or garden at
Gehol. It is called in Chinese <i>Van-shoo-yuen</i>, or Paradise of
ten thousand (or innumerable) trees. In order to have this
gratification (which is considered as an instance of uncommon
favour) we rose this morning at three o'clock and went
to the palace where we waited, mixed with all the great of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>ficers
of state, for three hours (such is the etiquette of the
place) till the Emperor's appearance. At last he came forth,
borne in the usual manner by sixteen persons on a high open
palankeen, attended by guards, music, standards, and umbrellas
without number; and observing us, as we stood in
the front line, graciously beckoned us to approach, having
ordered his people to stop; he entered into conversation
with us; and, with great affability of manner, told us that
he was on his way to the pagoda, where he usually paid his
morning devotions; that as we professed a different religion
from his he would not ask us to accompany him, but that
he had ordered his first minister and chief Collaos to conduct
us through his garden, and to shew us whatever we were desirous
of seeing there.</p>

<p>"Having expressed my sense of this mark of his condescension
in the proper manner, and my increasing admiration of
every thing I had yet observed at Gehol, I retired and,
whilst he proceeded to his adorations at the pagoda, I accompanied
the ministers and other great Collaos of the court to
a pavilion prepared for us, from whence, after a short collation,
we set out on horseback to view this wonderful garden.
We rode about three miles through a very beautiful park kept
in the highest order and much resembling the approach to
Luton in Bedfordshire; the grounds gently undulated and
chequered with various groupes of well contrasted trees in
the offskip. As we moved onward an extensive lake appeared
before us, the extremities of which seemed to lose
themselves in distance and obscurity. Here was a large and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>magnificent yacht ready to receive us, and a number of
smaller ones for the attendants, elegantly fitted up and
adorned with numberless vanes, pendants, and streamers.
The shores of the lake have all the varieties of shape, which
the fancy of a painter can delineate, and are so indented with
bays, or broken with projections, that almost every stroke of
the oar brought a new and unexpected object to our view.
Nor are islands wanting, but they are situated only where
they should be, each in its proper place and having its
proper character: one marked by a pagoda, or other
building; one quite destitute of ornament; some smooth
and level; some steep and uneven; and others frowning
with wood, or smiling with culture. Where any things
particularly interesting were to be seen we disembarked, from
time to time, to visit them, and I dare say that, in the
course of our voyage, we stopped at forty or fifty different
palaces or pavilions. These are all furnished in the
richest manner with pictures of the Emperor's huntings
and progresses, with stupendous vases of jasper and agate;
with the finest porcelain and Japan, and with every kind
of European toys and <i>sing-songs</i>; with spheres, orreries,
clocks, and musical automatons of such exquisite workmanship,
and in such profusion, that <i>our</i> presents must
shrink from the comparison, and <i>hide their diminished heads</i>;
and yet I am told, that the fine things we have seen are far
exceeded by others of the same kind in the apartments of the
ladies, and in the European repository at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>. In
every one of the pavilions was a throne, or imperial state,
and a <i>Eu-jou</i>, or symbol of peace and prosperity, placed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one side of it resembling that which the Emperor delivered
to me yesterday for the king.</p>

<p>"It would be an endless task were I to attempt a detail of
all the wonders of this charming place. There is no
beauty of distribution, no feature of amenity, no
reach of fancy which embellishes our pleasure grounds in
England, that is not to be found here. Had China been
accessible to Mr. Browne or Mr. Hamilton, I should have
sworn they had drawn their happiest ideas from the rich
sources, which I have tasted this day; for in the course of a
few hours I have enjoyed such vicissitudes of rural delight,
as I did not conceive could be felt out of England, being
at different moments enchanted by scenes perfectly similar to
those I had known there, to the magnificence of Stowe, the
softer beauties of Wooburn, and the fairy-land of Paine's
Hill.</p>

<p>"One thing I was particularly struck with, I mean the happy
choice of situation for ornamental buildings. From attention
to this circumstance they have not the air of being crowded
or disproportioned; they never intrude upon the eye; but
wherever they appear always shew themselves to advantage, and
aid, improve, and enliven the prospect.</p>

<p>"In many places the lake is overspread with the Nenuphar
or lotus (Nelumbium) resembling our broad leaved water lilly.
This is an accompaniment which, though the Chinese are
passionately fond of, cultivating it in all their pieces of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I confess I don't much admire. Artificial rocks and ponds
with gold and silver fish are perhaps too often introduced,
and the monstrous porcelain figures of lions and tygers,
usually placed before the pavilions, are displeasing to an European
eye; but these are trifles of no great moment; and
I am astonished that now, after a six hours critical survey of
these gardens, I can scarcely recollect any thing besides to find
fault with.</p>

<p>"At our taking leave of the minister, he told us that we had
only seen the eastern side of the gardens, but that the western
side, which was the larger part still remained for him to
shew us, and that he should have that pleasure another
day.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, on the day of the Emperor's anniversary festival,
after the ceremony was ended, the first or great Collao
<i>Ho-chun-tong</i>, the <i>Foo-leou</i>, the <i>Foo-leou</i>'s brothers <i>Foo-chan-tong</i>,
and <i>Song-ta-gin</i>, with the other great men who attended us
two days since, in our visit to the eastern garden, now proposed
to accompany us to the western, which forms a strong
contrast with the other, and exhibits all the sublimer beauties
of nature in as high a degree as the part which we saw before
possesses the attractions of softness and amenity. It is one
of the finest forest-scenes in the world; wild, woody, mountainous
and rocky, abounding with stags and deer of different
species, and most of the other beasts of the chase, not dangerous
to man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"In many places immense woods, chiefly oaks, pines, and
chesnuts, grow upon almost perpendicular steeps, and force
their sturdy roots through every resistance of surface and of
soil, where vegetation would seem almost impossible. These
woods often clamber over the loftiest pinnacles of the stony
hills, or gathering on the skirts of them, descend with a rapid
sweep, and bury themselves in the deepest vallies. There, at
proper distances, you find palaces, banquetting houses, and
monasteries, (but without bonzes) adapted to the situation
and peculiar circumstances of the place, sometimes with a
rivulet on one hand, gently stealing through the glade, at
other with a cataract tumbling from above, raging with
foam, and rebounding with a thousand echoes from below,
or silently engulphed in a gloomy pool, or yawning
chasm.</p>

<p>"The roads by which we approached these romantic scenes
are often hewn out of the living rock, and conducted round
the hills in a kind of rugged stair-case, and yet no accident
occurred in our progress, not a false step disturbed
the regularity of our cavalcade, though the horses are spirited
and all of them unshod. From the great irregularity of
the ground, and the various heights to which we ascended,
we had opportunities of catching many magnificent points of
view by detached glances, but after wandering for several
hours (and yet never wearied with wandering) we at last
reached a covered pavilion open on all sides, and situated on
a summit so elevated as perfectly to command the whole
surrounding country to a vast extent. The radius of the ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>rizon
I should suppose to be at least twenty miles from the
central spot where we stood; and certainly so rich, so
various, so beautiful, so sublime a prospect my eyes had
never beheld. I saw every thing before me as on an illuminated
map, palaces, pagodas, towns, villages, farm-houses,
plains, and vallies, watered by innumerable streams, hills
waving with woods, and meadows covered with cattle of the
most beautiful marks and colours. All seemed to be nearly at
my feet, and that a step would convey me within reach of them.</p>

<p>"I observed here a vast number of what we call in England
<i>sheet</i> cows, also sheet horses, many pyeballs, dappled, mottled,
and spotted, the latter chiefly strawberry.</p>

<p>"From hence was pointed out to us by the minister a vast
enclosure below, which, he said, was not more accessible to
him than to us, being never entered but by the Emperor, his
women, or his Eunuchs. It includes within its bounds,
though on a smaller scale, most of the beauties which distinguish
the eastern and the western gardens which we have
already seen; but from every thing I can learn it falls very
short of the fanciful descriptions which Father Attiret and
Sir William Chambers have intruded upon us as realities.
That within these private retreats, various entertainments
of the most novel and expensive nature are prepared
and exhibited by the Eunuchs, who are very numerous
(perhaps some thousands) to amuse the Emperor and his
ladies, I have no doubt; but that they are carried to all
the lengths of extravagance and improbability those gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>men
have mentioned, I very much question, as from every
enquiry I have made (and I have not been sparing to make
them) I have by no means sufficient reason to warrant me in
acceding to, or confirming, the accounts which they have
given us.</p>

<p>"If any place in England can be said in any respect to have
similar features to the western park, which I have seen this
day, it is Lowther Hall in Westmoreland, which (when I
knew it many years ago) from the extent of prospect, the
grand surrounding objects, the noble situation, the diversity
of surface, the extensive woods, and command of water, I
thought might be rendered by a man of sense, spirit, and
taste, the finest scene in the British dominions."</p>

<p>After the descriptive and interesting detail of the beauties of the
two sides of the imperial park or gardens of Gehol, his Lordship
makes a few general observations on Chinese gardening, and
the ornamental edifices that are usually employed to aid the
effect, as well as contribute to use and convenience. He
observes,</p>

<p>"Whether our style of gardening was really copied from the
Chinese, or originated with ourselves, I leave for vanity to
assert, and idleness to discuss. A discovery which is the result
of good sense and reflexion may equally occur to the
most distant nations, without either borrowing from the other.
There is certainly a great analogy between our gardening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and the Chinese, but our excellence seems to be rather in improving
nature, theirs to conquer her, and yet produce the
same effect. It is indifferent to a Chinese where he makes
his garden, whether on a spot favoured, or abandoned, by
the rural deities. If the latter, he invites them, or compels
them to return. His point is to change every thing from
what he found it, to explode the old fashion of the creation,
and introduce novelty in every corner. If there be a waste,
he adorns it with trees; if a dry desert, he waters it with a
river, or floats it with a lake. If there be a smooth flat, he varies
it with all possible conversions. He undulates the surface,
he raises it in hills, scoops it into vallies, and roughens it
with rocks. He softens asperities, brings amenity into the
wilderness, or animates the tameness of an expanse, by accompanying
it with the majesty of a forest. Deceptions and
eye-traps the Chinese are not unacquainted with, but they
use them very sparingly. I observed no artificial ruins,
caves, or hermitages. Though the sublime predominates in
its proper station, you are insensibly led to contemplate it,
not startled by its sudden intrusion, for in the plan cheerfulness
is the principal feature, and lights up the face of the
scene. To enliven it still more, the aid of architecture is
invited; all the buildings are perfect of their kind, either
elegantly simple, or highly decorated, according to the
effect that is intended to arise, erected at suitable distances,
and judiciously contracted, never crowded together in confusion,
nor affectedly confronted, and staring at each other
without meaning. Proper edifices in proper places. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
summer-house, the pavilion, the pagodas, have all their respective
situations, which <i>they</i> distinguish and improve, but
which any other structures would injure or deform. The
only things disagreeable to my eye are the large porcelain
figures of lions, tygers, &amp;c. and the rough hewn steps, and
huge masses of rock work, which they seem studious of introducing
near many of their houses and palaces. Considering
their general good taste in the other points, I was much
surprised at this, and could only account for it, by the expence
and the difficulty of bringing together such incongruities,
for it is a common effect of enormous riches to push
every thing they can procure to bombast and extravagance,
which are the death of taste. In other countries, however,
as well as in China, I have seen some of the most boasted feats,
either outgrowing their beauty from a plethora of their
owner's wealth, or becoming capricious and hypocondriacal
by a quackish application of it. A few fine places, even in
England, might be pointed out that are labouring under these
disorders; not to mention some celebrated houses where
twisted stair-cases, window-glass cupolas, and embroidered
chimney-pieces, convey nothing to us but the whims and
dreams of sickly fancy, without an atom of grandeur, taste,
or propriety.</p>

<p>"The architecture of the Chinese is of a peculiar style, totally
unlike any other, irreducible to our rules, but perfectly
consistent with its own. It has certain principles, from
which it never deviates, and although, when examined ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>cording
to ours, it sins against the ideas we have imbibed
of distribution, composition, and proportion; yet, upon
the whole, it often produces a most pleasing effect, as
we sometimes see a person without a single good feature
in his face have, nevertheless, a very agreeable countenance."</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">t</span> may, perhaps, be laid down as an invariable maxim, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the condition of the female part of society in any nation will
furnish a tolerable just criterion of the degree of civilization to
which that nation has arrived. The manners, habits, and prevailing
sentiments of women, have great influence on those of
the society to which they belong, and generally give a turn to
its character. Thus we shall find that those nations, where the
moral and intellectual powers of the mind in the female sex are
held in most estimation, will be governed by such laws as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
best calculated to promote the general happiness of the people;
and, on the contrary, where the personal qualifications of the
sex are the only objects of consideration, as is the case in all the
despotic governments of Asiatic nations, tyranny, oppression,
and slavery are sure to prevail; and these personal accomplishments,
so far from being of use to the owner, serve only to
deprive her of liberty, and the society of her friends; to render
her a degraded victim, subservient to the sensual gratification, the
caprice, and the jealousy of tyrant man. Among savage tribes
the labour and drudgery invariably fall heaviest on the weaker
sex.</p>

<p>The talents of women, in our own happy island, began only
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth to be held in a proper degree
of consideration. As women, they were admired and courted,
but they scarcely could be said to participate in the society of
men. In fact, the manners of our forefathers, before that reign,
were too rough for them. In Wales, wives were sold to their
husbands. In Scotland, women could not appear as evidences in
a court of justice. In the time of Henry the Eighth, an act
was passed prohibiting women and apprentices from reading the
New Testament in the English language. Among the polished
Greeks, they were held in little estimation. Homer degrades
all his females: he makes the Grecian princesses weave the
web, spin, and do all the drudgery of a modern washerwoman;
and rarely allows them any share of social intercourse
with the other sex. Yet the very foundations on which he has
constructed his two matchless poems are women. It appears
also from all the dramatic writers of ancient Greece, whose aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was "to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature, to shew the
very age and body of the time its form and pressure," that
notwithstanding their extreme delicacy of taste, and rapid progress
in the fine arts, their manners were low and coarse, and
that they were entire strangers to any other gratification arising
from the society of women, than the indulgence of the sensual
appetite. Even the grave Herodotus mentions, in the highest
terms of approbation, the custom of Babylon of selling by auction,
on a certain fixed day, all the young women who had
any pretensions to beauty, in order to raise a sum of money for
portioning off the rest of the females, to whom nature had been
less liberal in bestowing her gifts, and who were knocked down
to those who were satisfied to take them with the least money.
This degradation of women would seem to be as impolitic as
it is extraordinary since, under their guidance, the earliest,
and sometimes the most indelible (I believe I may safely add,
the best and most amiable) impressions are stamped on the youthful
mind. In infancy their protection is indispensably necessary,
and in sickness, or in old age, they unquestionably afford the best
and kindest relief: or, as a French author has neatly observed,
"<i>Sans les femmes, les deux extrémités de la vie seraient sans secours,
et le milieu sans plaisirs.</i>" "Without woman the two extremities
of life would be helpless, and the middle of it joyless."</p>

<p>The Chinese, if possible, have imposed on their women a
greater degree of humility and restraint than the Greeks of old,
or the Europeans in the dark ages. Not satisfied with the physical
deprivation of the use of their limbs, they have contrived,
in order to keep them the more confined, to make it a moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
crime for a woman to be seen abroad. If they should have occasion
to visit a friend or relation, they must be carried in a
close sedan chair: to walk would be the height of vulgarity.
Even the country ladies, who may not possess the luxury of a
chair, rather than walk, suffer themselves to be sometimes rolled
about in a sort of covered wheelbarrow. The wives and daughters,
however, of the lower class are neither confined to the house,
nor exempt from hard and slavish labour, many being obliged
to work with an infant upon the back, while the husband, in
all probability, is gaming, or otherwise idling away his time.
I have frequently seen women assisting to drag a sort of light
plough, and the harrow. Nieuwhoff, in one of his prints,
taken from drawings supposed to be made in China, yokes, if
I mistake not, a woman to the same plough with an ass. Should
this be the fact, the Chinese are not singular, if we may credit
the Natural Historian of Antiquity<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, who observes that, to open
the fertile fields of <i>Byzacium</i> in Africa, it was necessary to wait
until the rains had soaked into the ground; "after which a
little weakly ass, and an old woman, attached to the same
yoke, were sufficient to drag the plough through the soil,"
<i>post imbres vili asello, et a parte altera jugi anu vomerem trahente
vidimus scindi</i>.</p>

<p>In the province of <i>Kiang-see</i> nothing is more common than
to see a woman drawing a kind of light plough, with a single
handle, through ground that has previously been prepared.
The easier task of directing the machine is left to the husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>who, holding the plough with one hand, at the same time <a name="with" id="with"></a>with
the other casts the seed into the drills.</p>

<p>The advantages which those women possess in a higher sphere
of life, if any, are not much to be envied. Even at home, in
her own family, a woman must neither eat at the same table,
nor sit in the same room with her husband. And the male
children, at the age of nine or ten, are entirely separated from
their sisters. Thus the feelings of affection, not the instinctive
products of nature, but the offspring of frequent intercourse
and of a mutual communication of their little wants and pleasures,
are nipped in the very bud of dawning sentiment. A
cold and ceremonious conduct must be observed on all occasions
between the members of the same family. There is no common
focus to attract and concentrate the love and respect of
children for their parents. Each lives retired and apart from
the other. The little incidents and adventures of the day,
which furnish the conversation among children of many a long
winter's evening, by a comfortable fire-side, in our own country,
are in China buried in silence. Boys, it is true, sometimes
mix together in schools, but the stiff and ceremonious behaviour,
which constitutes no inconsiderable part of their education,
throws a restraint on all the little playful actions incident
to their time of life and completely subdues all spirit of activity
and enterprize. A Chinese youth of the higher class is
inanimate, formal, and inactive, constantly endeavouring to
assume the gravity of years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>To beguile the many tedious and heavy hours, that must unavoidably
occur to the secluded females totally unqualified for
mental pursuits, the tobacco-pipe is the usual expedient. Every
female from the age of eight or nine years wears, as an appendage
to her dress, a small silken purse or pocket to hold tobacco
and a pipe, with the use of which many of them are not
unacquainted at this tender age. Some indeed are constantly
employed in working embroidery on silks, or in painting birds,
insects, and flowers on thin gauze. In the ladies' apartments of
the great house in which we lived at Pekin, we observed some
very beautiful specimens of both kinds in the pannels of the
partitions, and I brought home a few articles which I understand
have been much admired; but the women who employ
their time in this manner are generally the wives and daughters
of tradesmen and artificers, who are usually the weavers
both of cottons and silks. I remember asking one of the great
officers of the court, who wore a silken vest beautifully embroidered,
if it was the work of his lady, but the supposition
that his wife should condescend to use her needle seemed to
give him offence.</p>

<p>Their manners in domestic life are little calculated to produce
that extraordinary degree of filial piety, or affection and
reverence towards parents, for which they have been eminently
celebrated, and to the salutary effects of which the Jesuits have
attributed the stability of the government. Filial duty is, in
fact, in China, less a moral sentiment, than a precept which
by length of time has acquired the efficacy of a positive law;
and it may truly be said to exist more in the maxims of the go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>vernment,
than in the minds of the people. Had they, indeed,
considered filial piety to be sufficiently strong when left to its
own natural influence, a precept or law to enforce it would
have been superfluous. The first maxim inculcated in early life
is the entire submission of children to the will of their parents.
The tenor of this precept is not only "to honour thy father
and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land;"
but to labour for thy father and thy mother as long as they
both shall live, to sell thyself into perpetual servitude for their
support, if necessary, and to consider thy life at their disposal.
So much has this sentiment of parental authority gained ground
by precept and habit, that to all intents and purposes it is as binding
as the strongest law. It gives to the parent the exercise of
the same unlimited and arbitrary power over his children, that
the Emperor, the common father, possesses by law over his
people. Hence, as among the Romans, the father has the
power to sell his son for a slave; and this power, either from
caprice, or from poverty, or other causes, is not unfrequently
put in force.</p>

<p>A law that is founded in reason or equity seldom requires
to be explained or justified. The government of China, in sanctioning
an act of parental authority that militates so strongly
against every principle of nature, of moral right and wrong,
seems to have felt the force of this remark. Their learned men
have been employed in writing volumes on the subject, the
principal aim of which appears to be that of impressing on the
minds of the people the comparative authority of the Emperor
over his subjects and of a parent over his children. The rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>sonableness
and justice of the latter being once established, that
of the former, in a patriarchal government, followed of course;
and the extent of the power delegated to the one could not in
justice be withheld from the other. And for the better allaying
of any scruples that might be supposed to arise in men's consciences,
it was easy to invent any piece of sophistry to serve
by way of justification for those unnatural parents who might
feel themselves disposed, or who from want might be induced,
to part with their children into perpetual slavery. A son, says
one of their most celebrated lawgivers, after the death of his
father, has the power of selling his services for a day, or a year,
or for life; but a father, while living, has unlimited authority
over his son; a father has, therefore, the same right of selling
the services of his son to another for any length of time, or even
for life.</p>

<p>Daughters may be said to be invariably sold. The bridegroom
must always make his bargain with the parents of his intended
bride. The latter has no choice. She is a lot in the
market to be disposed of to the highest bidder. The man, indeed,
in this respect, has no great advantage on his side, as he
is not allowed to see his intended wife until he arrives in formal
procession at his gate. If, however, on opening the door of
the chair, in which the lady is shut up, and of which the key
has been sent before, he should dislike his bargain, he can return
her to her parents; in which case the articles are forfeited
that constituted her price; and a sum of money, in addition to
them, may be demanded, not exceeding, however, the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
these articles. These matrimonial processions, attended with
pomp and music, are not unlike those used by the Greeks
when the bride was conducted to her husband's house in a splendid
car; only, in the former instance, the lady is completely
invisible to every one.</p>

<p>To what a degraded condition is a female reduced by this absurd
custom! How little inducement, it would be supposed,
she could have to appear amiable or elegant, or to study her
dress, or cramp her feet, or paint her face, knowing she will
be consigned into the hands of the first man who will give the
price that her parents have fixed upon her charms. No previous
conversation is allowed to take place, no exchange of opinions
or comparison of sentiments with regard to inclinations or
dislikes; all the little silent acts of attention and kindness, which
so eloquently speak to the heart, and demonstrate the sincerity
of the attachment, are utterly unfelt. In a word, that state of
the human heart, occasioned by the mutual affection between
the sexes, and from whence proceed the happiest, the most interesting,
and sometimes also, the most distressing moments of
life, has no existence in China. The man takes a wife because
the laws of the country direct him to do so, and custom has
made it indispensable; and the woman, after marriage, continues
to be the same piece of inanimate furniture she always was
in her father's house. She suffers no indignity, nor does she
feel any jealousy or disturbance (at least it is prudent not to
shew it) when her husband brings into the same house a second,
or a third woman. The first is contented with the honour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
presiding over, and directing the concerns of, the family within
doors, and in hearing the children of the others calling her
mother.</p>

<p>It might be urged, perhaps, on the part of the husband, that
it would be highly unreasonable for the woman to complain.
The man who purchased her ought to have an equal right in
the same manner to purchase others. The case is materially
different where parties are united by sentiments of love and
esteem, or bound by promises or engagements; under such circumstances
the introduction of a second wife, under the same
roof, could not fail to disturb the harmony of the family, and
occasion the most poignant feelings of distress to the first. But
a Chinese wife has no such feelings, nor does the husband make
any such engagements.</p>

<p>Although polygamy be allowed by the government, as indeed
it could not well happen otherwise where women are articles
of purchase, yet it is an evil that, in a great degree, corrects
itself. Nine-tenths of the community find it difficult to
rear the offspring of one woman by the labour of their hands;
such, therefore, are neither in circumstances, nor probably feel
much inclination, to purchase a second. The general practice
would, besides, be morally impossible. In a country where so
many female infants are exposed, and where the laws or custom
oblige every man to marry, any person taking to himself
two wives must leave some other without one, unless indeed it
be supposed with the author of <i>L'Esprit des Loix</i>, what there
seems to be no grounds for supposing, that a much greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
number of females are born than of males. But all the observations
of this lively and ingenious author with regard to China,
and particularly the inferences he draws with respect to climate,
fall to the ground. It is not the vigour of natural propensities,
as he has supposed, that destroys the moral ones; it is not the
effect of climate that makes it to be considered among these
people "as a prodigy of virtue for a man to meet a fine woman
in a retired chamber without offering violence to her,"&mdash;it
is the effect of studiously pampering the appetite, nurturing
vicious notions, considering women as entirely subservient to
the pleasures of man; and, in short, by fancying those pleasures
in the head, rather than feeling them in the heart, that
have led them to adopt a sentiment which does the nation so
little credit. The climate being every where temperate, and the
diet of the majority of the people moderate, I might say
scanty, these have little influence in promoting a vehement
desire for sexual intercourse. It is indeed among the upper
ranks only and a few wealthy merchants (whom the sumptuary
laws, prohibiting fine houses, gardens, carriages, and every
kind of external shew and grandeur, have encouraged secretly
to indulge and pamper their appetite in every species of luxury
and voluptuousness) where a plurality of wives are to be found.
Every great officer of state has his haram consisting of six, eight,
or ten women, according to his circumstances and his inclination
for the sex. Every merchant also of Canton has his seraglio;
but a poor man finds one wife quite sufficient for all his
wants, and the children of one woman as many, and sometimes
more, than he is able to support.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The unsociable distance which the law (or custom, stronger
than law) prescribes to be observed between the sexes, and
the cool and indifferent manner of bargaining for a wife,
are not calculated to produce numerous instances of criminal
intercourse. These, however, sometimes happen, and
the weight of punishment always fall heaviest on the woman.
The husband finds no difficulty in obtaining a sentence of divorce,
after which he may sell her for a slave and thus redeem
a part at least of his purchase-money. The same thing happens
in case a wife should elope, instances of which I fancy
are still more rare; as if she be of any fashion, her feet are ill
calculated to carry her off with speed; and if a young girl
should chance to lose what is usually held to be the most valuable
part of female reputation, she is sent to market by her parents
and publicly sold for a slave. In cases of mutual dislike, or incompatibility
of temper, the woman is generally sent back to
her parents. A woman can inherit no property, but it may be
left to her by will. If a widow has no children, or females
only, the property descends to the nearest male relation on the
deceased husband's side, but he must maintain the daughters until
he can provide them with husbands.</p>

<p>The prohibition against the frequent intercourse with modest
females, for there are public women in every great city, is not
attended here with the effect of rendering the pursuit more
eager; nor does it increase the ardour, as among the ancient
Spartans who were obliged to steal, as it were, the embraces
of their lawful wives. In China it seems to have the contrary
effect of promoting that sort of connexion which, being one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the greatest violations of the laws of nature, ought to be considered
among the first of moral crimes&mdash;a connexion that sinks
the man many degrees below the brute. The commission of
this detestable and unnatural act is attended with so little
sense of shame, or feelings of delicacy, that many of the first
officers of state seemed to make no hesitation in publicly avowing
it. Each of these officers is constantly attended by his
pipe-bearer, who is generally a handsome boy from fourteen to
eighteen years of age, and is always well dressed. In pointing
out to our notice the boys of each other, they made use of signs
and motions, the meaning of which was too obvious to be misinterpreted.
The two Mahomedans, I observe, who were in
China in the ninth century, have also taken notice of this circumstance:
and I find in the journal of Mr. Hittner, a gentleman
who was in that part of the suite who accompanied the British
Embassador into Tartary, in speaking of the palaces of Gehol,
the following remark: "Dans l'un de ces palais, parmi d'autres
chefs-d'&oelig;uvres de l'art, on voyait deux statues de garçons, en
marbre, d'un excellent travail; ils avaient les pieds et les
mains liés, et leur position ne laissait point de doute que le
vice des Grecs n'eût perdu son horreur pour les Chinois. Un
vieil eunuque nous les fit remarquer avec un sourire impudent."</p>

<p>It has been remarked that this unnatural crime prevails most
in those countries where polygamy is allowed, that is to say, in
those countries where the affections of women are not consulted,
but their persons purchased for gold&mdash;a remark which
may lead to this conclusion, that it is rather a moral turpitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
than a propensity arising from physical or local causes. The
appetite for female intercourse soon becomes glutted by the facility
of enjoyment; and where women, so circumstanced, can
only receive the embraces of their proprietors from a sense of
duty, their coldness and indifference, the necessary consequence
of such connections, must also increase in the men the tendency
to produce satiety. I think it has been observed that, even in
Europe, where females in general have the superior advantage
of fixing their own value upon themselves, it is the greatest
rakes and debauchees, who,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"&mdash;&mdash;bred at home in idleness and riot,<br />
Ransack for mistresses th' unwholesome stews,<br />
And never know the worth of virtuous love."<br />
</div></div>

<p>fly sometimes in search of fresh enjoyment in the detestable way
here alluded to<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the state of domestic society in
China was ill calculated to promote the affection and kindness
which children not only owe to, but really feel for, their parents
in many countries of Europe. A tyrant, in fact, to command,
and a slave to obey, are found in every family; for, where
the father is a despot, the son will naturally be a slave; and if
all the little acts of kindness and silent attentions, that create
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>mutual endearments, be wanting among the members of the
same family, living under the same roof, it will be in vain to expect
to find them in the enlarged sphere of public life. In fact,
they have no kind of friendly societies nor meetings to talk
over the transactions and the news of the day. These can only
take place in a free government. A Chinese having finished his
daily employment retires to his solitary apartment. There are,
it is true, a sort of public houses where the lower orders of
people sometimes resort for their cup of tea or of <i>seau-tchoo</i> (a
kind of ardent spirit distilled from a mixture of rice and other
grain) but such houses are seldom, if at all, frequented for the
sake of company. They are no incitement, as those are of a
similar kind in Europe, to jovial pleasures or to vulgar ebriety.
From this odious vice the bulk of the people are entirely free.
Among the multitudes which we daily saw, in passing from one
extremity of the country to the other, I do not recollect having
ever met with a single instance of a man being disguised in
liquor. In Canton, where the lower orders of people are employed
by Europeans and necessarily mix with European seamen,
intoxication is not unfrequent among the natives, but this
vice forms no part of the general character of the people. Whenever
a few Chinese happen to meet together, it is generally for
the purpose of gaming, or to eat a kettle of boiled rice, or drink a
pot of tea, or smoke a pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>The upper ranks indulge at home in the use of opium. Great
quantities of this intoxicating drug are smuggled into the country,
notwithstanding all the precautions taken by the government
to prohibit the importation of it; but it is too expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to be used by the common people. The officers of the customs
are not beyond a bribe. After receiving the sum agreed upon
between the importer and themselves they frequently become
the purchasers of the prohibited article. Most of the country
ships from Bengal carry opium to China; but that of Turkey
sent from London in the China ships is preferred, and sells at
near double the price of the other. The governor of Canton,
after describing in one of his late proclamations on the subject
the pernicious and fatal effects arising from the use of opium,
observes, "Thus it is that foreigners by the means of a vile excrementitious
substance derive from this empire the most
solid profits and advantages; but that our countrymen should
blindly pursue this destructive and ensnaring vice, even till
death is the consequence, without being undeceived, is indeed
a fact odious and deplorable in the highest degree." Yet
the governor of Canton very composedly takes his daily dose of
opium.</p>

<p>The young people have no occasional assemblies for the
purpose of dancing and of exercising themselves in feats of activity
which, in Europe, are attended with the happy effects of
shaking off the gloom and melancholy that a life of constant
labour or seclusion from society is apt to promote. They have
not even a fixed day of rest set apart for religious worship.
Their acts of devotion partake of the same solitary cast
that prevails in their domestic life. In none of the different
sects of religion, which at various times have been imported
into, and adopted in China, has congregational worship been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
inculcated, which, to that country in particular, may be considered
as a great misfortune. For, independent of religions
considerations, the sabbatical institution is attended with advantages
of a physical as well as of a moral nature; and humanity
is not less concerned than policy in consecrating one day out of
seven, or some other given number, to the service of the great
Creator, and to rest from bodily labour. When the government
of France, in the height of her rage for innovation, fell into
the hands of atheistical demagogues, when her temples were
polluted and every thing sacred was invaded and profaned, the
seventh day was considered as a relic of ancient superstition and
the observance of it accordingly abolished; and, about the
same time, it became the fashion among a certain description
of people to use specious arguments against its continuance
in our own country; as being, for example, a day for the
encouragement of idleness, drunkenness, and dissipation.
Such a remark could only be applied to large cities and towns;
and in crowded manufacturing towns the mechanic, who can
subsist by working three days in the week, would be at no loss
in finding opportunities, were there no sabbath day, in the course
of the other four to commit irregularities. And who, even for
the sake of the mechanic and artificer, would wish to see the
labouring peasant deprived of one day's rest, out of seven, which
to him is more precious than the wages he has hardly earned
the other six? What man, possessed of common feelings of
humanity, in beholding the decent and modest husbandman,
accompanied by his family in their best attire attending the
parish-church, does not participate in the smile of content
which on this day particularly beams on his countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and bespeaks the serenity of his mind? Having on this day discharged
his duty to God, refreshed his body with rest, enjoyed
the comfort of clean clothing, and exercised his mind in conversing
with his neighbours, he returns with double vigour to
his daily labour; having, as Mr. Addison observes in one of
his Spectators, rubbed off the rust of the week.</p>

<p>The first of the new year in China, and a few succeeding
days, are the only holidays, properly speaking, that are observed
by the working part of the community. On these days the
poorest peasant makes a point of procuring new clothing for
himself and his family; they pay their visits to friends and
relations, interchange civilities and compliments, make and receive
presents; and the officers of government and the higher
ranks give feasts and entertainments. But even in those feasts there
is nothing that bears the resemblance of conviviality. The
guests never partake together of the same service of dishes, but
each has frequently his separate table; sometimes two, but never
more than four, sit at the same table; and their eyes must constantly
be kept upon the master of the feast, to watch all his
motions, and to observe every morsel he puts into his mouth,
and every time he lifts the cup to his lips; for a Chinese of good-breeding
can neither eat nor drink without a particular ceremony,
to which the guests must pay attention. If a person invited
should, from sickness or any accident, be prevented from
fulfilling his engagement, the portion of the dinner that was intended
to be placed on his table is sent in procession to his own
house; a custom that strongly points out the very little notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
they entertain of the <i>social</i> pleasures of the table. It is customary
to send after each guest the remains even of his dinner.
Whenever in the course of our journey we visited a governor
or viceroy of a province, we generally found him at the head
of a range of tables, covered with a multitude of dishes, which
invariably were marched after us to the yachts. Martial, if I
mistake not, has some allusion to a similar custom among the
Romans. Each carried his own napkin to a feast, which being
filled with the remains of the entertainment was sent home by
a slave; but this appears to have been done more out of compliment
to the host, to shew the great esteem in which they held
his cheer, than for the sake of the viands; for the Romans
loved conviviality.</p>

<p>The Chinese also, like the ancient Egyptians as exemplified
in the enormous mess which Joseph gave to little Benjamin
above the rest of his brothers, testify, on all occasions, that they
consider the measure of a man's stomach to depend more upon
the rank of its owner than either his bulk or appetite. The Embassador's
allowance was at least five times as great as that of any
person in his suite. In this particular, however, these nations
are not singular, neither in ancient nor in modern times. The
kings of Sparta, and indeed every Grecian hero, were always
supposed to eat twice the quantity of a common soldier; and
the only difference with regard to our heroes of the present day
consists in their being enabled to convert quantity into quality,
an advantage for which they are not a little indebted to the
invention of money, into which all other articles can be commuted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever may be the occasion of bringing together a few
idlers, they seldom part without trying their luck at some game
of chance for which a Chinese is never unprepared. He rarely
goes abroad without a pack of cards in his pocket or a pair of
dice. Both of these, like almost every thing else in the country,
are different from similar articles elsewhere. Their cards
are much more numerous than ours, and their games much
more complicated. Nor are they at any loss, even if none of
the party should happen to be furnished with cards or dice; on
such an emergency their fingers are employed to answer the
purpose, which are all that is required to play the game of <i>Tsoi-moi</i>,
a game of which the lower class of people is particularly
fond. Two persons, sitting directly opposite to each other,
raise their hands at the same moment, when each calls out the
number he guesses to be the sum of the fingers expanded by
himself and his adversary. The closed fist is none, the thumb
one, the thumb and forefinger two, &amp;c. so that the chances lie
between 0 and 5, as each must know the number held out by
himself. The middling class of people likewise play at this
game when they give entertainments where wine is served, and
the loser is always obliged to drink off a cup of wine. At this
childish game two persons will sometimes play to a very late
hour, till he who has had the worst of the game has been
obliged to drink so much wine that he can no longer see either to
count his own or his adversary's fingers. I have thus particularly
noticed the Chinese <i>Tsoi-moi</i>, on account of the extraordinary
coincidence between it and a game in use among the Romans,
to which frequent allusion is made by Cicero. In a note by
Melancthon on Cicero's Offices it is thus described. "<i>Micare
digitis</i>, ludi genus est. Sic ludentes, simul digitos alterius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
manus quot volunt citissime erigunt, et simul ambo divinant
quot simul erecti sint; quod qui definivit, lucratus est: unde
acri visu opus est, et multa fide, ut cum aliquo in tenebris mices."
"<i>Micare digitis</i>, is a kind of game. Those who play at it
stretch out, with great quickness, as many fingers of one hand
each, as they please, and at the same instant both guess how
many are held up by the two together; and he who guesses
right wins the game: hence a sharp sight is necessary, and
also great confidence when it is played in the dark."</p>

<p>The Chinese have certainly the <i>acer visus</i>, but I doubt much
whether they have faith enough in each other's integrity to play
at the game of fingers in the dark, which, in the opinion of Cicero,
was a strong test of a truly honest man. The same game
is said to be still played in Italy under the name of <i>Morra.</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The officers about Yuen-min-yuen used to play a kind of chess,
which appeared to me to be essentially different from that game
as played by the Persians, the Indians, and other oriental nations,
both with regard to the lines drawn on the board, the form of
the chess-men, and the moves, from which I should rather conclude
it to be a game of their own invention, than an introduction
either from India or by the army of <i>Gengis-khan</i>, as some
authors have conjectured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p><p>The spirit of gaming is so universal in most of the towns
and cities, that in almost every bye-corner, groupes are to be
found playing at cards or throwing dice. They are accused
even of frequently staking their wives and children on the hazard
of a die. It may easily be conceived that where a man
can sell his children into slavery, there can be little remorse,
in the breast of a gamester reduced to his last stake, to risk
the loss of what the law has sanctioned him to dispose of.
Yet we are very gravely assured by some of the reverend missionaries,
that "the Chinese are entirely ignorant of all games of
chance;" that "they can enjoy no amusements but such as are
authorized by the laws." These gentlemen surely could not
be ignorant that one of their most favourite sports is cock-fighting,
and that this cruel and unmanly <i>amusement</i>, as they are
pleased to consider it, is full as eagerly pursued by the upper
classes in China as, to their shame and disgrace be it spoken, it
continues to be by those in a similar situation in some parts of
Europe. The training of quails for the same cruel purpose of
butchering each other furnishes abundance of employment for
the idle and dissipated. They have even extended their enquiries
after fighting animals into the insect tribe, in which they
have discovered a species of <i>gryllus</i>, or locust, that will attack each
other with such ferocity as seldom to quit their hold without
bringing away at the same time a limb of their antagonist.
These little creatures are fed and kept apart in bamboo cages;
and the custom of making them devour each other is so common
that, during the summer months, scarcely a boy is seen
without his cage and his grasshoppers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>I have already had occasion to observe that the natural disposition
of the Chinese should seem to have suffered almost a total
change by the influence of the laws and maxims of government,
an influence which, in this country more than elsewhere, has
given a bias to the manners, sentiments, and moral character of
the people; for here every ancient proverb carries with it the
force of a law. While they are by nature quiet, passive, and
timid, the state of society and the abuse of the laws by which
they are governed, have rendered them indifferent, unfeeling,
and even cruel, as a few examples, which among many others
occurred, will but too clearly bear evidence; and as the particular
instances, from which I have sometimes drawn an inference,
accorded with the common actions and occurrences of life, I have
not hesitated to consider them as so many general features in their
moral character; at the same time I am aware that allowances
ought to be made for particular ways of thinking, and for customs
entirely dissimilar from our own, which are, therefore,
not exactly to be appreciated by the same rule as if they had
occurred in our own country. The public feasts of Sparta, in
which the girls danced naked in presence of young men, had
not the same effect on the Lacedemonian youth, as they might
be supposed to produce in Europe; nor is the delicacy of the
Hindoo women offended by looking on the Lingam. Thus
the Chinese are entitled to our indulgence by the peculiar circumstances
under which they are placed, but I leave it in the
breast of the reader to make what allowance he may think they
deserve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The common practice of flogging with the bamboo has generally
been considered by the missionaries in the light of a gentle
correction, exercised by men in power over their inferiors,
just as a father would chastise his son, but not as a punishment
to which disgrace is attached. However lightly these gentlemen
may chuse to treat this humiliating chastisement, to which
all are liable from the prime minister to the peasant, it is but
too often inflicted in the anger and by the caprice of a man in
office, and frequently with circumstances of unwarrantable
cruelty and injustice. Of the truth of this remark we had several
instances. In our return down the <i>Pei-ho</i>, the water being
considerably shallower than when we first sailed up this river,
one of our accommodation barges got aground in the middle of
the night. The air was piercing cold, and the poor creatures
belonging to the vessel were busy until sun-rise in midst of
the river, using their endeavours to get her off. The rest
of the fleet had proceeded, and the patience of the superintending
officer at length being exhausted, he ordered
his soldiers to flog the captain and the whole crew; which was
accordingly done in a most unmerciful manner and this was
their only reward for the use of the yacht, their time and
labour for two days. The instance of degrading an officer and
flogging all his people, because the meat brought for our use
was a little tainted when the temperature was at 88° in the
shade, I have already had occasion to notice.</p>

<p>Whenever the wind was contrary, or it was found necessary
to track the vessels against the stream, a number of men were
employed for this purpose. The poor creatures were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
pressed into this disagreeable and laborious service, for which
they were to receive about six-pence a day so long as they
tracked, without any allowance being made to them for returning
to the place from whence they were forced. These people
knowing the difficulty there was of getting others to supply their
places, and that their services would be required until such should
be procured, generally deserted by night, disregarding their pay.
In order to procure others, the officers dispatched their soldiers to
the nearest village, taking the inhabitants by surprize and
forcing them out of their beds to join the yachts. Scarcely
a night occurred in which some poor wretches did not suffer
the lashes of the soldiers for attempting to escape, or for pleading
the excuse of old age, or infirmity. It was painful to behold
the deplorable condition of some of these creatures. Several
were half naked and appeared to be wasting and languishing
for want of food. Yet the task of dragging along the vessels
was far from being light. Sometimes they were under the necessity
of wading to the middle in mud; sometimes to swim
across creeks, and immediately afterwards to expose their naked
bodies to a scorching sun; and they were always driven by a
soldier or the lictor of some petty police officer carrying in his
hand an enormous whip, with which he lashed them with as
little reluctance as if they had been a team of horses.</p>

<p>The Dutch Embassy proceeded by land to the capital, in the
middle of winter, when the rivers and canals were frozen. The
thermometer was frequently from 8 to 16 degrees below the
freeing point, and the face of the country was mostly covered
with ice and snow; yet they were often under the neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>sity
of travelling all night; and the peasantry, who were pressed
to carry the presents and their baggage, notwithstanding their
heavy loads, were obliged to keep up with them as long as they
could. In the course of two nights, Mr. Van Braam observes,
not less than eight of these poor wretches actually expired
under their burdens, through cold, hunger, fatigue, and the
cruel treatment of their drivers.</p>

<p>It had been the practice of some of the gentlemen of the
British embassy, in their return through the country, to walk
during a part of the day, and to join the barges towards the
hour of dinner. One day an officer of high rank took it into
his head to interrupt them in their usual walk, and for this
purpose dispatched after them nine or ten of his soldiers, who
forced them in a rude manner to return to the vessels. Our
two conductors <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i>, coming up at the time, and being
made acquainted with the circumstance, gave to each of the
soldiers a most severe flogging. One of these, who had been
particularly insolent, had his ears bored through with iron wire,
and his hands bound to them for several days. The viceroy
of Canton was at this time with the embassy, and being in rank
superior to the offending officer, he ordered the latter to appear
before him, gave him a severe reprimand, and sentenced him to
receive forty strokes of the bamboo as a <i>gentle correction</i>. Our
two Chinese friends were particularly pressing that the gentlemen
insulted should be present at the punishment of the officer, and
it was not without difficulty they could be persuaded that such a
scene would not afford them any gratification. It happened also,
in the Dutch embassy, that an inferior officer was flogged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
disgraced by their conductors for not having in readiness a sufficient
number of coolies or porters to proceed with the baggage,
and to carry the sedan chairs in which they travelled.</p>

<p>The tyranny that men in office exercise over the multitude,
and each other, is perfectly agreeable to the systematic subordination
which the law has sanctioned. But as authority is a
dangerous deposit in the hands of the wisest, and leads sometimes
the most wary to</p>

</div></div>

<p>what must the effects of it be when vested in an illiterate Chinese
or rude Tartar who has no other talent or recommendation
for his authority than the power alone which his office
allows him to exercise?</p>

<p>Several instances however occurred in the course of our journey
through the country, which seemed to mark the same unfeeling
and hard-hearted disposition to exist between persons of equal
condition in life, as in men in office over their inferiors. One
of these afforded an extraordinary trait of inhumanity. A poor
fellow at Macao, in the employ of the British factory there,
fell by accident from a wall and pitched upon his skull. His
companions took him up with very little appearance of life
and, in this state, were carrying him away towards the skirts
of the town, where they were met by one of the medical gentlemen
belonging to the embassy. He interrogated them what
they meant to do with the unfortunate man, and was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
coolly answered, they were going to bury him. Having expressed
his astonishment that they should think of putting a
man into the grave before the breath was out of his body, they
replied that they were of opinion he never could recover, and
that if they carried him home he would only be a trouble and
expence to his friends so long as he remained in a situation which
rendered him unable to assist himself. The man, however, by
the humanity and attention of Doctor Scott, was restored again
to his family and to those friends who knew so well to appreciate
the value of his life.</p>

<p>The doctor however was not aware of the risk he ran in thus
exercising his humanity, as by a law of the country, which appears
to us extraordinary, if a wounded man be taken into the
protection and charge of any person with a view to effect his
recovery, and he should happen to die under his hands, the person
into whose care he was last taken is liable to be punished
with death, unless he can produce undeniable evidence to prove
how the wound was made, or that he survived it forty days.
The consequence of such a law is, that if a person should happen
to be mortally wounded in an affray, he is suffered to die in the
streets, from the fear (should any one take charge of him) of
being made responsible for his life.</p>

<p>A striking instance of the fatal effects of such a law happened
at Canton lately. A fire broke out in the suburbs and three
Chinese, in assisting to extinguish it, had their limbs fractured
and were otherwise dreadfully wounded by the falling of a wall.
The surgeon of the English factory, with all the alacrity to ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>minister
relief to suffering humanity, which characterizes the profession
in Britain, directed them to be carried to the factory, and
was preparing to perform amputation, as the only possible means
of saving their lives, when one of the Hong merchants having
heard what was going on ran with great haste to the place,
and entreated the surgeon by no means to think of performing
any operation upon them, but rather to suffer them to be taken
away from the factory as speedily as possible; adding that, however
good his intentions might be, if any one of the patients
should die under his hands, he would inevitably be tried for murder,
and the most mitigated punishment would be that of banishment
for life into the wilds of Tartary. The wounded Chinese
were accordingly removed privately, and, no doubt, abandoned
to their fate.</p>

<p>The operation of such a barbarous law (for so it appears
to us) will serve to explain the conduct of the Chinese in the
following instance. In the course of our journey down the
grand canal we had occasion to witness a scene, which was
considered as a remarkable example of a want of fellow-feeling.
Of the number of persons who had crowded down to the banks of
the canal several had posted themselves upon the high projecting
stern of an old vessel which, unfortunately, breaking down
with the weight, the whole groupe tumbled with the wreck into
the canal, just at the moment when the yachts of the embassy were
passing. Although numbers of boats were sailing about the place,
none were perceived to go to the assistance of those that were struggling
in the water. They even seemed not to know that such an
accident had happened, nor could the shrieks of the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
floating on pieces of the wreck, attract their attention. One
fellow was observed very busily employed in picking up, with
his boat-hook, the hat of a drowning man. It was in vain we
endeavoured to prevail on the people of our vessel to heave to
and send the boat to their assistance. It is true, we were then
going at the rate of seven miles an hour, which was the plea
they made for not stopping. I have no doubt that several of
these unfortunate people must inevitably have perished.</p>

<p>Being thus insensible to the sufferings of their companions
and countrymen, little compassion is to be expected from them
towards strangers. From a manuscript journal, kept by a gentleman
in the suite of the Dutch Embassador, it appears that,
on their route to the capital, the writer felt an inclination to try
his skaits on a sheet of ice that they passed by the road-side; he
was also urged to it by the conducing officers. Having proceeded
to some distance from the shore, the ice gave way and
he fell in up to the neck. The Chinese, instead of rendering
him any assistance, in the absence of his own countrymen who
had gone forwards, ran away laughing at this accident and
left him to scramble out as well as he could, which was not
effected without very great difficulty.</p>

<p>But, if further proofs were wanting to establish the insensible
and incompassionate character of the Chinese, the horrid practice
of infanticide, tolerated by custom and encouraged by the
government, can leave no doubt on this subject.&mdash;I venture to
say encouraged, because where the legislature does not interfere
to prevent crimes, it certainly may be said to lend them its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
countenance. No law, however, allows, as I observe it noticed
in a modern author of reputation, a father to expose all the
daughters and the third son. I believe the laws of China do
not suppose such an unnatural crime to exist, and have therefore
provided no punishment for it. It is true, they have left a
child to the entire disposal of the father, concluding, perhaps,
that if his feelings will not prevent him from doing an injury,
no other consideration will. Thus, though the commission of
infanticide be frequent in China, it is considered as more prudent
to wink at it as an inevitable evil which natural affection
will better correct than penal statues; an evil that, on the other
hand, if publicly tolerated, would directly contradict the grand
principle of filial piety, upon which their system of obedience
rests, and their patriarchal form of government is founded.</p>

<p>It is, however, tacitly considered as a part of the duty of the
police of Pekin to employ certain persons to go their rounds,
at an early hour in the morning, with carts, in order to pick up
such bodies of infants as may have been thrown out into the
streets in the course of the night. No inquiries are made, but the
bodies are carried to a common pit without the city walls, into
which all those that may be living, as well as those that are dead,
are said to be thrown promiscuously. At this horrible pit of destruction
the Roman Catholic missionaries, established in Pekin,
attend by turns as a part of the duties of their office, in order,
as one of them expressed himself to me on this subject, to chuse
among them those that are the most <i>lively</i>, to make future
proselytes, and by the administration of baptism to such of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
rest as might be still alive, <i>pour leur sauver l'âme</i>. The Mahomedans
who, at the time that their services were useful in assisting to
prepare the national calendar, had a powerful influence at
Court, did much better: these zealous bigots to a religion,
whose least distinguishing feature is that of humanity, were,
however, on these occasions, the means of saving the <i>lives</i> of all
the little innocents they possibly could save from this maw of
death, which was an humane act, although it might be for the
purpose of bringing them up in the principles of their own faith.
I was assured by one of the Christian missionaries, with whom I
had daily conversation during a residence of five weeks within
the walls of the Emperor's palace at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, and who
took his turn in attending, <i>pour leur sauver l'ame</i>, that such
scenes were sometimes exhibited on these occasions as to make
the feeling mind shudder with horror. When I mention that
dogs and swine are let loose in all the narrow streets of the capital,
the reader may conceive what will sometimes necessarily
happen to the exposed infants, before the police-carts can pick
them up.</p>

<p>The number of children thus unnaturally and inhumanly
slaughtered, or interred alive, in the course of a year, is differently
stated by different authors, some making it about ten
and others thirty thousand in the whole empire. The truth, as
generally happens, may probably lie about the middle. The
missionaries, who alone possess the means of ascertaining nearly
the number that is thus sacrificed in the capital, differ very materially
in their statements: taking the mean, as given by those
with whom we conversed on the subject, I should conclude that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
about twenty-four infants were, on an average, in Pekin, daily
carried to the pit of death where the little innocents that have
not yet breathed their last are condemned without remorse,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"&mdash;&mdash;to be stifled in the vault,<br />
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br />
And there die."<br />
</div></div>

<p>This calculation gives nine thousand nearly for the capital
alone, where it is supposed about an equal number are exposed
to that of all the other parts of the empire. Those, whose
constant residence is upon the water, and whose poverty, or superstition,
or total insensibility, or whatever the cause may be
that leads them to the perpetration of an act against which nature
revolts, sometimes, it is said, expose their infants by
throwing them into the canal or river with a gourd tied round
their necks, to keep the head above water, and preserve them
alive until some humane person may be induced to pick them
up. This hazardous experiment, in a country where humanity
appears to be reduced to so low an ebb, can only be considered
as an aggravation of cruelty. I have seen the dead body of an
infant, but without any gourd, floating down the river of Canton
among the boats, and the people seemed to take no more
notice of it than if it had been the carcase of a dog: this, indeed,
would in all probability have attracted their attention, dogs being
an article of food commonly used by them; the miserable half-famished
Chinese, living upon the water, are glad to get any
thing in the shape of animal food, which they will even eat in a
state of putrefaction. Yet, little scrupulous as they are with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
regard to diet, I am not credulous enough to believe the information
of a Swedish author<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to be correct in his statement of a
cure for a certain disease, though "he has no reason to doubt
of the fact," <i>per <ins title="teknophagian">&#964;&#949;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#957;</ins> alternis diebus, alternis jejunio&mdash;by
eating children every other day!</i></p>

<p>A picture so horrid in its nature as the exposing of infants
presents to the imagination is not to be surpassed among the
most savage nations. The celebrated legislator of Athens made
no law to punish parricide, because he considered it as a crime
against nature, too heinous ever to be committed, and that the
bare supposition of such a crime would have disgraced the country.
The Chinese, in like manner, have no positive law against infanticide.
The laws of the rude and warlike Spartans allowed
infanticide, of which, however, the parents were not the perpetrators,
nor the abettors. Nor, among these people, were the
weak and sickly children, deemed by the magistrates unlikely
ever to become of use to themselves, or to the public, thrown
into the <ins title="apothêkê">&#945;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#951;</ins>, or common repository of the dead bodies of
children, until life had been previously extinguished, we will
charitably suppose, by gentle and the least painful means.</p>

<p>The exposing of children, however, it must be allowed, was
very common among the ancients. The stern and rigid virtues
of the Romans allowed this among many other customs, that
were more unnatural than amiable, and such as in civilized societies
of the present day would have been considered among
the most atrocious of moral crimes. A Roman father, if his in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>fant
was meant to be preserved, lifted it from the ground in his
arms; if he neglected that ceremony, the child, it would seem,
was considered as doomed to exposure in the highway. Thus,
in the Andrian of Terence, where, though the scene is not laid
in Rome, Roman customs are described, "quidquid peperisset,
decreverunt tollere." "Let it be boy or girl they have resolved
to lift it from the ground." Nor indeed is secret infanticide
unknown in modern Europe, although it may be owing
to a different principle. In such cases, the sense of shame and
the fear of encountering the scorn and obloquy of the world
have determined the conduct of the unhappy mother, before
the feelings of nature could have time to operate. For I am
willing to hope that none who had ever experienced a mother's
feelings and a mother's joy would consent by any means, direct
or indirect, or under any impression of fear of shame, of scorn,
or biting penury, to the destruction of a new-born babe. And
I may venture to say with confidence, that a British cottager,
however indigent, would divide his scanty pittance among a
dozen children rather than consent to let some of them perish,
that he and the rest might fare the better, were even our laws
as tacit on this subject as those of China.</p>

<p>Some of the Christian missionaries, in their accounts of this
country, have attempted to palliate the unnatural act of exposing
infants, by attributing it to the midwife, who they pretend
to say, from knowing the circumstances of the parents, strangle
the child without the knowledge of the mother, telling her that
the infant was still-born. Others have ascribed the practice to a
belief in the metempsycosis, or transmigration of souls into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
other bodies, that the parents, seeing their children must
be doomed to poverty, think it is better at once to let the
soul escape in search of a more happy asylum, than to linger in
one condemned to want and wretchedness. No degree of superstition,
one would imagine, could prevail upon a parent to
reason thus, in that most anxious and critical moment when
the combined efforts of hope and fear, of exquisite joy and
severe pain, agitate by turns the mother's breast. Besides, the
Chinese trouble themselves very little with superstitious notions,
unless where they apprehend some personal danger. Nor is it
more probable that the midwife should take upon herself the
commission of a concealed and voluntary murder of an innocent
and helpless infant, for the sake of sparing those feelings in another,
of which the supposition implies she could not possibly
partake; and if she should be encouraged by the father, whose
affections for an infant child may be more gradually unfolded
than the mother's, to perpetrate so horrid an act, we must allow
that to the evidence of unnatural and murtherous parents must
be added that of hired ruffians; so that Chinese virtue would
gain little by such a supposition.</p>

<p>It is much more probable that extreme poverty and hopeless
indigence, the frequent experience of direful famines, and the
scenes of misery and calamity occasioned by them, acting on
minds whose affections are not very powerful, induce this unnatural
crime which common custom has encouraged, and which is
not prohibited by positive law. That this is the case, and that
future advantages are not overlooked, will appear from the circumstance
of almost all the infants that are exposed being fe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>males,
who are the least able to provide for themselves, and the
least profitable to their parents; and the practice is most frequent
in crowded cities, where not only poverty more commonly
prevails, but so many examples daily occur of inhumanity,
of summary punishments, acts of violence and cruelty,
that the mind becomes callous and habituated to scenes that once
would have shocked, and is at length scarcely susceptible of the
enormity of crimes.</p>

<p>I am afraid, however, it is but too common a practice even in
the remotest corners of the provinces. A respectable French missionary,
now in London, who was many years in <i>Fo-kien</i>, told
me that he once happened to call on one of his converts just at
the moment his wife was brought to-bed. The devoted infant
was delivered to the father in order to be plunged into a jar of
water that was prepared for the purpose. The missionary expostulated
with the man on the heinousness of an act that was a
crime against God and nature. The man persisted that, having
already more than he could support, it would be a greater crime
to preserve a life condemned to want and misery, than to take it
away without pain. The missionary, finding that no argument
of his was likely to divert him from his purpose, observed
"that, as a Christian, he could not refuse him the satisfaction of
saving the infant's soul by baptism." During the ceremony, as
the father held the infant in his arms he happened to fix his
eyes on its face, when the missionary thought he perceived the
feelings of nature begin to work; and he protracted the ceremony
to give time for the latent spark of parental affection to
kindle into flame. When the ceremony was ended; "Now,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
says the missionary, "I have done my duty in saving a soul
from perishing." "And I," rejoined the man, "will do
mine, by saving its life," and hurried away with the infant to
deposit it in the bosom of its mother.</p>

<p>How very weak then, in reality, must be the boasted filial
affection of the Chinese for their parents, when they scruple not
to become the murderers of their own children, towards whom,
according to the immutable laws of nature, the force of affection
will ever be stronger than for those whom the laws of China, in
preference, have commanded to be protected and supported
when rendered incapable of assisting themselves. The truth of
this observation, which I believe few will call in question, is a
strong proof that, as I have already remarked, filial piety
among the Chinese may rather be considered in the light of an
ancient precept, carrying with it the weight of a positive law,
than the effect of sentiment.</p>

<p>It is right to mention here (what however is no palliation of
the crime, though a diminution of the extent of it) a circumstance
which I do not recollect to have seen noticed by any
author, and the truth of which I have too good authority
to call in question. As every corpse great and small must be
carried to a place of burial at a considerable distance without
the city, and as custom requires that all funerals should be conducted
with very heavy expences, people in Pekin, even those
in comfortable circumstances, make no hesitation in laying
in baskets still-born children, or infants who may die the
first month, knowing that they will be taken up by the police.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
This being the case, we may easily conceive that, in a city said
to contain three millions of people, a great proportion of the
nine thousand, which we have supposed to be annually exposed,
may be of the above description. According to the rules of political
arithmetic, and supposing half of those who died to be exposed,
the number would be diminished to about 4000. The expence
attending a Chinese funeral is more extravagant than an
European can well conceive. A rich Hong merchant at Canton
is known to have kept his mother near twelve months above
ground, because it was not convenient for him to bury her in a
manner suitable to his supposed wealth and station.</p>

<p>I am informed also that foundling hospitals do exist in China,
but that they are on a small scale, being raised and supported by
donations of individuals, and their continuance is therefore
as precarious as the wealth of their charitable founders.</p>

<p>These unfavourable features in the character of a people, whose
natural disposition is neither ferocious nor morose; but, on the
contrary, mild, obliging, and cheerful, can be attributed only to
the habits in which they have been trained, and to the heavy
hand of power perpetually hanging over them. That this is
actually the case may be inferred from the general conduct and
character of those vast multitudes who, from time to time, have
emigrated to the Philippine islands, Batavia, Pulo Pinang and
other parts of our East Indian settlements. In those places they
are not less remarkable for their honesty, than for their peaceable
and industrious habits. To the Dutch in Batavia they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
masons, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, shopkeepers, bankers,
and, in short, every thing. Indolence and luxury are there
arrived to such a height that, without the assistance of the
Chinese, the Dutch would literally be in danger of starving.
Yet the infamous government of that place, in the year 1741,
caused to be massacred, in cold blood, many thousands of these
harmless people who offered no resistance; neither women nor
children escaped the fury of these blood-hounds.</p>

<p>In these places it appears also, that their quickness at invention
is not surpassed by accuracy of imitation, for which they
have always been accounted remarkably expert in their own
country. Man is, by nature, a hoarding animal; and his endeavours
to accumulate property will be proportioned to the
security and stability which the laws afford for the possession
and enjoyment of that property. In China, the laws regarding
property are insufficient to give it that security: hence the talent
of invention is there seldom exercised beyond suggesting the
means of providing for the first necessities and the most pressing
wants. A man, indeed, is afraid here to be considered as
wealthy, well knowing that some of the rapacious officers of
the state would find legal reasons to extort his riches from him.</p>

<p>The exterior deportment of every class in China is uncommonly
decent, and all their manners mild and engaging; but even these
among persons of any rank are considered as objects worthy the
interference of the legislature; hence it follows that they are ceremonious
without sincerity, studious of the forms only of politeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
without either the ease or elegance of good-breeding. An inferior
makes a sham attempt to fall on his knees before his superior, and
the latter affects a slight motion to raise him. A common salutation
has its mode prescribed by the court of ceremonies; and any
neglect or default in a plebeian towards his superior is punishable
by corporal chastisement, and in men in office by degradation or
suspension. In making thus the exterior and public manners of
the people a concern of the legislature, society in many respects
was considerably benefited. Between equals, and among the
lower orders of people, abusive language is very unusual, and
they seldom proceed to blows. If a quarrel should be carried
to this extremity, the contest is rarely attended with more serious
consequences than the loss of the long lock of hair growing
from the crown of the head, or the rent of their clothes. The
act of drawing a sword, or presenting a pistol, is sufficient to
frighten a common Chinese into convulsions; and their warriors
shew but few symptoms of bravery. The Chinese may
certainly be considered among the most timid people on the
face of the earth; they seem to possess neither personal courage,
nor the least pretence of mind in dangers or difficulties; consequences
that are derived probably from the influence of the
moral over the physical character. Yet there is perhaps no
country where acts of suicide occur more frequently than in
China, among the women as well as the men: such acts being
marked with no disgrace, are not held in any abhorrence. The
government, indeed, should seem to hold out encouragement to
suicide, by a very common practice of mitigating the sentence
of death, in allowing the criminal to be his own executioner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The late viceroy of Canton, about two years ago, put an end
to his life by swallowing his stone snuff-bottle, which stuck in
the oesophagus; and he died in excruciating agonies.</p>

<p>In a government, where every man is liable to be made a slave,
where every man is subject to be flogged with the bamboo at
the nod of one of the lowest rank of those in office, and where
he is compelled to kiss the rod that beats him or, which amounts
to the same thing, to thank the tyrant on his knees for the trouble
he has taken to correct his morals, high notions of honour
and dignified sentiments are not to be expected. Where the
maxims of the government commanding, and the opinions of
the people agreeing, that corporal punishment may be inflicted,
on the ground of a favour conferred upon the person
punished, a principle of humiliation is admitted that is well
calculated to exclude and obliterate every notion of the dignity
of human nature.</p>

<p>A slave, in fact, cannot be dishonoured. The condition itself
of being dependent upon and subject to the caprice of
another, without the privilege of appeal, is such a degraded state
of the human species, that those who are unfortunately reduced
to it have no further ignominy or sense of shame to undergo.
The vices of such a condition are innumerable, and they
appear on all occasions among this people celebrated (rather undeservedly
I think) for their polished manners and civilized government.
A Chinese merchant will cheat, whenever an opportunity
offers him the means, because he is considered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
incapable of acting honestly; a Chinese peasant will steal when
ever he can do it without danger of being detected, because the
punishment is only the bamboo, to which he is daily liable;
and a Chinese prince, or a prime minister, will extort the property
of the subject, and apply it to his private use, whenever
he thinks he can do it with impunity. The only check upon
the rapacity of men in power is the influence of fear, arising
from the possibility of detection: the love of honour, the dread
of shame, and a sense of justice, seem to be equally unfelt by
the majority of men in office.</p>

<p>It would be needless to multiply instances to those already on
record of the refined knavery displayed by Chinese merchants
in their dealings with Europeans, or the tricks that they play off
in their transactions with one another. They are well known
to most nations, and are proverbial in their own. A merchant
with them is considered as the lowest character in the country,
as a man that will cheat if he can, and whose trade it is to
create and then supply artificial wants. To this general character,
which public opinion has most probably made to be
what it is, an exception is due to those merchants who, acting
under the immediate sanction of the government, have always
been remarked for their liberality and accuracy in their dealings
with Europeans trading to Canton. These men who are styled
the <i>Hong</i> merchants, in distinction to a common merchant whom
they call <i>mai-mai-gin</i>, <i>a buying and selling man</i>, might not unjustly
be compared with the most eminent of the mercantile
class in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>But as traders in general are degraded in all the state maxims,
and consequently in public opinion, it is not surprising they should
attach so little respect to the character of foreign merchants trading
to their ports, especially as several knavish tricks have been
practised upon them, in spite of all their acuteness and precaution.
The gaudy watches of indifferent workmanship, fabricated
purposely for the China market and once in universal demand,
are now scarcely asked for. One gentleman in the Honourable
East India Company's employ took it into his head
that cuckoo clocks might prove a saleable article in China, and
accordingly laid in a large assortment, which more than answered
his most sanguine expectations. But as these wooden
machines were constructed for sale only, and not for use, the
cuckoo clocks became all mute long before the second arrival of
this gentleman with another cargo. His clocks were now not
only unsaleable, but the former purchasers threatened to return
theirs upon his hands, which would certainly have been done,
had not a thought entered his head, that not only pacified his
former customers but procured him also other purchasers for
his second cargo&mdash;he convinced them by undeniable authorities,
that the cuckoo was a very odd kind of bird which sung only at
certain seasons of the year, and assured them that whenever the
proper time arrived, all the cuckoos they had purchased would
once again "tune their melodious throats." After this it would
only be fair to allow the Chinese sometimes to trick the European
purchaser with a wooden ham instead of a real one.</p>

<p>But as something more honourable might be expected in a
prince of the blood, a grandson of the Emperor, I shall just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
mention one anecdote that happened during my abode in the
palace of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>. This gentleman, then about five-and-twenty
years of age, having no ostensible employment,
came almost daily to the hall of audience, where we were arranging
the presents for the Emperor. He had frequently desired
to look at a gold time-piece which I wore in my pocket; one
morning I received a message from him, by one of the missionaries,
to know if I would sell it and for what price. I explained
to the missionary that, being a present from a friend
and a token of remembrance, I could not willingly part with it,
but that I would endeavour to procure him one equally good from
our artificers who I thought had such articles for sale. I soon
discovered, however, that his Royal Highness had already been
with these people, but did not like their prices. The following
morning a second missionary came to me, bringing a present
from the prince consisting of about half a pound of common
tea, a silk purse, and a few trumpery trinkets, hinting at the
same time, that he was expected to carry back the watch in return
as an equivalent. I requested the missionary immediately
to take back the princely present, which he did with considerable
reluctance, dreading his Highness's displeasure. The poor
fellow happened to have a gold watch about him, which he
was desired to shew; and the same day he had a visit from
one of the prince's domestics to say, that his master would do
him the honour to accept his watch; which he was not only
under the necessity of sending, but was obliged to thank him,
on his knees, for this extraordinary mark of distinction. He
told me, moreover, that this same gentleman had at least a
dozen watches which had been procured in the same honourable
way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>In the list of presents carried by the late Dutch Embassador
were two grand pieces of machinery, that formerly were a part
of the curious museum of the ingenious Mr. Coxe. In the
course of the long journey from Canton to Pekin they had
suffered some slight damage. On leaving the capital they discovered,
through one of the missionaries, that while these
pieces were under repair, the prime minister <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>
had substituted two others of a very inferior and common sort
to complete the list, reserving the two grand pieces of clock-work
for himself, which, at some future period, he would,
perhaps, take the merit of presenting to the Emperor in his
own name.</p>

<p>These examples but too clearly illustrate <a name="letter_a" id="letter_a"></a>a great defect in
the boasted moral character of the Chinese. But the fault, as
I before observed, seems to be more in the system of government
than in the nature and disposition of the people. The
accession of a foreign power to the throne, by adopting the language,
the laws, and the customs of the conquered, has preserved
with the forms all the abuses of the ancient government. The
character of the governors may differ a little, but that of the governed
remains unchanged. The Tartars, by assuming the
dress, the manners, and the habits of the Chinese, by being
originally descended from the same stock, and by a great resemblance
of features, are scarcely distinguishable from them
in their external appearance. And if any physical difference
exist, it seems to be in stature only, which may have arisen
from local causes. The Chinese are rather taller, and of a more
slender and delicate form than the Tartars, who are in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
short, thick, and robust. The small eye, elliptical at the end
next to the nose, is a predominating feature in the cast of both
the Tartar and the Chinese countenance, and they have both
the same high cheek bones and pointed chins, which, with
the custom of shaving off the hair, gives to the head the shape
of an inverted cone, remarkable enough in some subjects, but
neither so general, nor so singular, as to warrant their being
considered among the <i>monsters</i> in nature, <i>Homo monstrosus</i>, <i>macrocephalus</i>,
<i>capite conico</i>, <i>Chinensis</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The head of our worthy
conductor <a name="van-ta-gin" id="van-ta-gin"></a><i>Van-ta-gin</i>, who was a real Chinese, had nothing in
its shape different from that of an European, except the eye.
The portrait of this gentleman, drawn by Mr. Hickey, is so
strong a likeness, and he was deservedly so great a favourite of
every Englishman in the train of the British Embassador, that I
am happy in having in opportunity of placing it at the head of
this work.</p>

<p>The natural colour both of the Chinese and Tartars seems to
be that tint between a fair and dark complexion, which we distinguish
the word <i>brunet</i> or <i>brunette</i>; and the shades of this complexion
are deeper, or lighter, according as they have been
more or less exposed to the influence of the climate. The
women of the lower class, who labour in the fields or who
dwell in vessels, are almost invariably coarse, ill-featured, and
of a deep brown complexion, like that of the Hottentot. But
this we find to be the case among the poor of almost every nation.
Hard labour, scanty fare, and early and frequent parturi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>tion,
soon wither the delicate buds of beauty. The sprightliness
and expression of the features, as well as the colour of the
skin, which distinguish the higher ranks from the vulgar, are
the effects of ease and education. We saw women in China,
though very few, that might pass for beauties even in Europe.
The Malay features however prevail in most; a small black or
dark brown eye, a short rounded nose, generally a little flattened,
lips considerably thicker than in Europeans, and black
hair, are universal.</p>

<p>The Mantchoo Tartars would appear to be composed of a
mixed race: among these we observed several, both men and
women, that were extremely fair and of florid complexions:
some had light blue eyes, straight or aquiline noses, brown hair,
immense bushy beards, and had much more the appearance of
Greeks than of Tartars. It is certainly not improbable that the
Greeks of Sogdiana, whose descendants must have blended with
the western Tartars and with whom the Mantchoos were
connected, may have communicated this cast of countenance.
<i>Tchien-lung</i>, whose nose was somewhat aquiline and complexion
florid, used to boast of his descent from <i>Gengis-khan</i>:
these, however, are exceptions to the general character, which
is evidently the same as that of the Chinese.</p>

<p>But although their appearance and manners are externally
the same, a closer acquaintance soon discovers that in disposition
they are widely different. Those who are better pleased with a
blunt sincerity bordering on rudeness than a studied complaisance
approaching to servility; who may think it better to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
robbed openly than cheated civilly, will be apt to give the preference
to the Tartar character. Yet those Tartars of distinction,
who fill some of the higher situations in the state, soon
<a name="lose" id="lose"></a>lose their native roughness and are scarcely distinguishable in
their manners and demeanour from the Chinese.</p>

<p>The ease, politeness, and dignified carriage of the old viceroy
of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, who was a Mantchoo, could not be exceeded
by the most practiced courtier in modern Europe: the attention
he shewed to every thing that concerned the embassy, the unaffected
manner in which he received and entertained us at
<i>Tien-sing</i>; the kindness and condescension with which he gave
his orders to the inferior officers and to his domestics, placed him
in a very amiable point of view. He was a very fine old man of
seventy-eight years of age, of low stature, with small sparkling
eyes, a benign aspect, a long silver beard, and the whole of
his appearance calm, venerable, and dignified. The manners
of <i>Sun-ta-gin</i>, a relation of the Emperor and one of the six ministers
of state, were no less dignified, easy, and engaging; and
<i>Chung-ta-gin</i>, the new viceroy of Canton, was a plain, unassuming,
and good-natured man. The prime minister <i>Ho-chang-tong</i>,
the little Tartar legate, and the ex-viceroy of Canton, were
the only persons of rank among the many we had occasion to
converse with that discovered the least ill-humour, distant hauteur,
and want of complaisance. All the rest with whom we had
any concern, whether Tartars or Chinese, when in our private
society, were easy, affable, and familiar, extremely good-humoured,
loquacious, communicative. It was in public only,
and towards each other, that they assumed their ceremonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
gravity, and practised all the tricks of demeanour which custom
requires of them.</p>

<p>The general character, however, of the nation is a strange
compound of pride and meanness, of affected gravity and real
frivolousness, of refined civility and gross indelicacy. With an
appearance of great simplicity and openness in conversation,
they practise a degree of art and cunning against which an
European is but ill prepared. Their manner of introducing the
subject of the court ceremonies in conversation with the Embassador
is no bad specimen of their sly address in managing matters
of this sort. Some of them observed, by mere accident as
it were, how curious it was to see the different modes of dress
that prevailed among different nations: this naturally brought
on a comparison between theirs and ours, the latter of which
they pretended to examine with critical attention. After a good
deal of circumlocutory observations, they thought their own
entitled to the preference, being more convenient, on account
of its being made wide and loose and free from tight ligatures;
whereas ours must be exceedingly uneasy and troublesome in
any other posture than that of standing upright; and particularly
so in making the genuflections and prostrations which were
customary and indeed necessary to be performed by all persons
whenever the Emperor appeared in public. No notice being
taken of this broad hint, so artfully introduced, they proceeded
to compare their wide petticoats with our breeches, and to contrast
the play and freedom of their knee-joints with the obstruction
that our knee-buckles and garters must necessarily occasion.
This brought them directly to the point, and they finished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
recommending, in the warmth of their friendship, that we
should disencumber ourselves of our breeches, as they would
certainly be inconvenient to appear in at court.</p>

<p>Of perseverance in negociation, or more properly speaking,
<i>in driving a bargain</i>, the Tartar legate gave no bad specimen of
his talent. Having in vain practiced every art to obtain from
the Embassador an unconditional compliance with the court
ceremony, he was sent at length by the Prime Minister to
inform him, that the important point was finally decided
and that the English mode was to be adopted; but, he observed,
that as it was not the custom of China to kiss the Emperor's
hand, he had something to propose to which there could be no
objection, and which was that, in lieu of that part of the
English ceremony, he should put the second knee upon the
ground and, instead of bending one knee, to kneel on both.
In fact, they negociate on the most trifling point with as much
caution and preciseness, as if they were forming a treaty of
peace, and with more address than some treaties of peace have
been negociated.</p>

<p>As a direct refusal to any request would betray a want of
good breeding, every proposal finds their immediate acquiescence;
they promise without hesitation, but generally disappoint
by the invention of some sly pretence or plausible
objection. They have no proper sense of the obligations of
truth. So little scrupulous indeed are they with regard to
veracity, that they will assert and contradict without blushing,
as it may best suit the purpose of the moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The vanity of an usurped national superiority and a high
notion of self-importance never forsake them on any occasion.
Those advantages in others which they cannot avoid feeling,
they will affect not to see. And although they are reduced to
the necessity of employing foreigners to regulate their calendar
and keep their clocks in order, although they are in the habit of
receiving yearly various specimens of art and ingenuity from
Europe, yet they pertinaciously affect to consider all the nations
of the earth as barbarians in comparison of themselves. A
Chinese merchant of Canton, who, from the frequent opportunities
of seeing English ships, was not insensible of their advantages
over those of his own nation which traded to Batavia
and other distant ports, resolved, and actually began, to construct
a vessel according to an English model; but the <i>Hoo-poo</i>
or collector of the customs being apprized of it, not only
obliged him to relinquish his project but fined him in a heavy
penalty for presuming to adopt the modes of a barbarous
nation. So great is their national conceit that not a single
article imported into the country, as I have elsewhere observed,
retains its name. Not a nation, nor person, nor object, that
does not receive a Chinese appellation: so that their language,
though poor, is pure.</p>

<p>The expressions made use of in salutation, by different nations,
may perhaps be considered as deriving their origin from
features of national character. <i>Lau-ye</i>, <i>Old sir</i>, is a title of respect,
with which the first officers of state may be addressed, because
the maxims of government have inculcated the doctrine of
obedience, respect, and protection to old age. The common
salutation among the lower orders of people in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
southern provinces is <i>Ya fan</i>, <i>Have you eaten your rice?</i> the
greatest happiness that the common class of people in China
can hope to enjoy consisting in their having a sufficiency of
rice. Thus also the Dutch, who are considered as great
eaters, have a morning salutation which is common among all
ranks, <i>Smaakelyk eeten!</i> <i>May you eat a hearty dinner!</i> Another
universal salutation among this people is, <i>Hoe vaart uwe?</i> <i>How do
you sail?</i> adopted no doubt in the early periods of the Republic,
when they were all navigators and fishermen. The usual
salutation at Cairo is, How do you sweat? a dry hot skin being
a sure indication of a destructive ephemeral fever. I think some
author has observed, in contrasting the haughty Spaniard with
the frivolous Frenchman, that the proud steady gait and inflexible
solemnity of the former were expressed in his mode of salutation,
<i>Come esta?</i> <i>How do you stand?</i> whilst the <i>Comment vous
portez vous?</i> <i>How do you carry yourself?</i> was equally expressive
of the gay motion and incessant action of the latter.</p>

<p>The Chinese are so ceremonious among themselves, and so
punctilious with regard to etiquette, that the omission of the
most minute point established by the court of ceremonies is
considered as a criminal offence. Visiting by tickets, which with
us is a fashion of modern refinement, has been a common practice
in China some thousand years; but the rank of a Chinese visitor
is immediately ascertained by the size, colour, and ornaments
of his ticket, which also varies in all these points according to
the rank of the person visited. The old Viceroy of <i>Pe-tche-lee's</i>
ticket to the Embassador contained as much crimson-coloured
paper as would be sufficient to cover the walls of a moderate-sized
room.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">fter</span> the sketch I have exhibited of the state of society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
among the different ranks in China, a tolerable notion may be
formed of the general character and complexion of the court.
It is, as Lord Macartney has justly observed, "a singular mixture
of ostentatious hospitality and inbred suspicion, ceremonious
civility and real rudeness, shadowy complaisance and substantial
perverseness; and this prevails through all the departments
connected with the Court, although somewhat modified
by the personal disposition of those at their head; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to that genuine politeness, which distinguishes our manners, it
cannot be expected in Orientals, considering among other
things the light in which they are accustomed to regard the
female part of society." Whether the great ministers of
state, who have daily intercourse in the different tribunals, sometimes
relax from the stiff and formal deportment observed towards
each other in public, I am not able to say, but when at
Court they invariably observe certain stated forms and expression
as studied and ceremonious as if they had never met before.
It appeared to us highly ridiculous to see our friends, the
two colleagues <i>Van-ta-gin</i> and <i>Chou-ta-gin</i>, on meeting in the
precincts of the palace, performing to each other all the genuflexions
and motions of the body which the ceremonial
institutes of the empire require.</p>

<p>I rather suspect, however, that where any degree of confidence
prevails among these people they sometimes enjoy their
moments of conviviality. Our two worthy conductors met at
Canton an old acquaintance who was governor of a city in Fo-kien.
He gave them an evening entertainment on the river in a
splendid yacht to which I was privately invited. On entering
the great cabin I found the three gentlemen with each a young
girl by his side very richly dressed, the cheeks, lips, and chin
highly <i>rouged</i>, the rest of the face and neck whitened with a preparation
of cerate. I was welcomed by a cup of hot wine from
each of the ladies who first sipped by way of pledging me.
During supper, which for number and variety of dishes exceeded
any thing I had hitherto met with in the country, the
girls played on the flute and sung several airs, but there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>thing
very captivating either in the vocal or instrumental part of
the music. We passed a most convivial evening free from any
reserve or restraint, but on going away I was particularly desired
by <i>Van</i> not to take any notice of what I had seen, apprehensive,
I suppose, that their brother officers might condemn their want
of prudence in admitting a barbarian to witness their relaxation
from good morals. The yacht and the ladies it seemed were
hired for the occasion.</p>

<p>The incalculable numbers of the great officers of state and
their attendants, all robed in the richest silks, embroidered with
the most brilliant colours, and tissued with gold and silver,
the order, silence, and solemnity with which they arrange and
conduct themselves on public court-days are the most commanding
features on such occasions.</p>

<p>This sober pomp of Asiatic grandeur is exhibited only at
certain fixed festivals; of which the principal is the anniversary
of the Emperor's birth-day, the commencement of a new year,
the ceremonial of holding the plough, and the reception of foreign
embassadors, most of whom they contrive to be present
at one or other of those festivals. The birth-day is considered to
be the most splendid; when all the Tartar princes and tributuaries,
and all the principal officers of government both civil
and military, are expected to be present.</p>

<p>For reasons of state, which will be noticed hereafter, the Emperor
rarely shews himself in public among the Chinese part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of his subjects, except on such occasions; and even then the
exhibition is confined within the precincts of the palace from
which the populace are entirely excluded. Consistent with
their system of sumptuary laws there is little external appearance
of pomp or magnificence in the establishment of the Emperor.
The buildings that compose the palace and the furniture
within them, if we except the paint, the gilding, and the
varnish, that appear on the houses even of plebeians, are equally
void of unnecessary and expensive ornaments. Those who
should rely on the florid relations, in which the missionaries and
some travellers have indulged in their descriptions of the palaces
of Pekin and those of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, would experience on visiting
them a woful disappointment. These buildings, like the
common habitations of the country, are all modelled after the
form of a tent, and are magnificent only by a comparison with
the others and by their number, which is sufficient, indeed, to
form a town of themselves. Their walls are higher than
those of ordinary houses, their wooden columns of greater
diameter, their roofs are immense, and a greater variety of
painting and gilding may be bestowed on the different parts;
but none of them exceeds one story in height, and they are
jumbled and surrounded with mean and insignificant hovels.
Some writer has observed that the King of England is worse
lodged at Saint James's palace than any sovereign in Europe.
Were I to compare some of the imperial palaces in China to any
royal residence in Europe it would certainly be to Saint James's;
but the apartments, the furniture, and conveniences of the latter,
bad as they are, infinitely transcend any of those in China.
The stone or clay floors are indeed sometimes covered with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
carpet of English broad-cloth, and the walls papered; but they
have no glass in the windows, no stoves, fire-places, or fire-grates
in the rooms; no sofas, bureaux, chandeliers, nor looking-glasses;
no book-cases, prints, nor paintings. They have
neither curtains nor sheets to their beds; a bench of wood, or
a platform of brick-work, is raised in an alcove, on which are
mats or stuffed mattresses, hard pillows, or cushions, according
to the season of the year; instead of doors they have usually
skreens, made of the fibres of bamboo. In short, the wretched
lodgings of the state-officers at the court of Versailles, in the
time of the French monarchy, were princely palaces in comparison
of those allotted to the first ministers of the Emperor
of China, in the capital as well as at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>.</p>

<p>When attending the court, on public occasions, each courtier
takes his meal alone in his solitary cell on a small square table
crowded with bowls of rice and various stews; without table-linen
or napkins, without knife, fork, or spoon; a pair of small
sticks, or the quills of a porcupine, are the only substitutes for
these convenient articles: placing the bowl under his chin,
with these he throws the rice into his mouth and takes up the
pieces of meat in his soup or stews. Having finished his lonely
meal, he generally lies down to sleep. In a government so
suspicious as that of China, if parties were known to meet
together, the object of them might be supposed something
beyond that of conviviality, which however mutual jealousy and
distrust have prevented from growing into common use.</p>

<p>As the ready compliance of the late Dutch Embassadors with
all the degrading ceremonies required by the Chinese, added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their constant residence in the capital, gave them more opportunities
of observing the manners and the amusements of the
court than occurred to the British embassy, I shall here avail
myself of that part of a journal relating to this subject, which
was kept by a young gentleman in the suite of the former,
and whose accuracy of observation may be depended on. The
account given by him of the New Year's festival, added to
Lord Macartney's description of his introduction and the
birth-day solemnities, which his Lordship has obligingly permitted
me to extract from his journal, together with my own
observations at the palace of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, will serve to convey
a tolerably exact idea of the state, pleasures, and amusements
of the great Monarch of China.</p>

<p>"On the 14th September," observes his Lordship, "at four
o'clock in the morning we set out for the court, under the
convoy of <i>Van-ta-gin</i>, and <i>Chou-ta-gin</i>, and reached it in little
more than an hour, the distance being about three miles
from our hotel. We alighted at the park gate, from whence
we walked to the Imperial encampment, and were conducted
to a large handsome tent prepared for us, on one side of the
Emperor's. After waiting there about an hour, his approach
was announced by drums and music, on which we
quitted our tent and came forward upon the green carpet.
He was seated in an open Palankeen, carried by sixteen
bearers, attended by numbers of officers bearing flags, standards,
and umbrellas; and as he passed we paid him our
compliments, by kneeling on one knee, whilst all the Chinese
made their usual prostrations. As soon as he had
ascended his throne I came to the entrance of his tent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
holding in both my hands a large gold box, enriched with
diamonds, in which was enclosed the King's letter, I walked
deliberately up and, ascending the steps of the throne, delivered
it into the Emperor's own hands, who, having received it,
passed it to the Minister by whom it was placed
on the cushion. He then gave me, as the first present from
him to his Majesty, the <i>Eu-shee</i>, or symbol of peace and
prosperity, and expressed his hopes that my Sovereign and
he should always live in good correspondence and amity.
It is a whitish agate-looking stone, perhaps serpentine, about
a foot and a half long, curiously carved, and highly prized
by the Chinese; but to me it does not appear in itself to be
of any great value.</p>

<p>"The Emperor then presented me with an <i>Eu-shee</i> of a
greenish-coloured serpentine stone, and of the same emblematic
character; at the same time he very graciously
received from me a pair of beautiful enamelled watches, set
with diamonds which, having looked at, he passed to the
Minister.</p>

<p>"Sir George Staunton (whom, as he had been appointed
Minister plenipotentiary, to act in case of my death or departure,
I introduced to him as such) now came forward, and
after kneeling upon one knee, in the same manner as I had
done, presented to him two elegant air-guns, and received from
him an <i>Eu-shee</i> of greenish stone nearly similar to mine.
Other presents were sent, at the same time, to all the gentlemen
of my train. We then descended from the steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
throne, and sat down upon cushions at one of the tables on
the Emperor's left hand. And at other tables, according to
their different ranks, the chief Tartar princes and the Mandarins
of the court at the same time took their places; all
dressed in the proper robes of their respective ranks. These
tables were then uncovered and exhibited a sumptuous
banquet. The Emperor sent us several dishes from his own
table, together with some liquors, which the Chinese call
wine; not however expressed from the grape, but distilled
or extracted from rice, herbs, and honey.</p>

<p>"In about half an hour he sent for Sir George Staunton and
me to come to him and gave to each of us, with his own
hands, a cup of warm wine, which we immediately drank
in his presence, and found it very pleasant and comfortable,
the morning being cold and raw. Among other things he
asked me the age of my Sovereign and, being informed
of it, said he hoped he might live as many years as himself
which were then eighty-three. His manner was dignified,
but affable and condescending; and his reception of us was
very gracious and satisfactory.</p>

<p>"The order and regularity in serving and removing the
dinner was wonderfully exact, and every function of the
ceremony performed with such silence and solemnity as
in some measure to resemble the celebration of a religious
mystery.</p>

<p>"There were present on this occasion three Embassadors
from <i>Ta-tze</i> or Pegu, and six Mahomedan Embassadors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
from the Kalmucs of the south-west, but their appearance
was not very splendid. During the ceremony, which lasted
five hours, various entertainments of wrestling, tumbling,
wire-dancing, together with dramatic representations, were
exhibited opposite the Emperor's tent, but at a considerable
distance from it.</p>

<p>"The 17th of September, being the Emperor's birth day,
we set out for the court at three o'clock in the morning,
conducted by <i>Van-ta-gin</i>, <i>Chou-ta-gin</i>, and our usual attendants.
We reposed ourselves about two hours in a large
saloon at the entrance of the palace enclosure, where fruit,
tea, warm milk, and other refreshments were brought to us.
At last notice was given that the festival was going to begin,
and we immediately descended into the garden, where we
found all the great men and mandarins in their robes of
state, drawn up before the Imperial pavilion. The Emperor
did not shew himself, but remained concealed
behind a screen, from whence I presume he could see and
enjoy the ceremonies without inconvenience or interruption.
All eyes were turned towards the place where his Majesty
was imagined to be enthroned, and seemed to express an
impatience to begin the devotions of the day. Slow, solemn
music, muffled drums, and deep-toned bells, were heard at
a distance;&mdash;on a sudden the sounds ceased, and all was
still&mdash;again they were renewed, and then intermitted with
short pauses; during which several persons passed backwards
and forwards, in the proscenium or foreground of the tent,
at if engaged in preparing some <i>grand coup-de-theatre</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"At length the great band, both vocal and instrumental,
struck up with all their powers of harmony, and instantly
the whole court fell flat upon their faces before this invisible
Nebuchadnezzar, whilst</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"He in his cloudy tabernacle shrined<br />
Sojourned the while."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"The music might be considered as a sort of birth-day ode, or
state anthem, the burthen of which was, '<i>Bow down your
heads all ye dwellers upon earth, bow down your heads before
the great Kien-long, the great Kien-long</i>.' And then all the
dwellers upon China earth there present, except ourselves,
bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves upon
the ground at every renewal of the chorus. Indeed,
in no religion either ancient or modern has the divinity ever
been addressed, I believe, with stronger exterior marks of
worship and adoration than were this morning paid to the
phantom of his Chinese majesty. Such is the mode of celebrating
the Emperor's anniversary festival, according to the
court ritual. We saw nothing of him the whole day,
nor did any of his ministers, I imagine, approach him,
for they all seemed to retire at the same moment that we
did.</p>

<p>"In the course of a tour we made in the gardens with the
prime minister and other great officers of state, whom the
Emperor had directed to attend us, we were entertained at
one of the palaces with a collation of petitpatis, salt relishes,
and other savoury dishes, with fruits and sweetmeats, milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and ice-water; and as soon as we rose from table, a number
of yellow boxes, or drawers, were carried in procession before
us, containing several pieces of silk and porcelain, which
we were told were presents to us from the Emperor, and we
consequently made our bows as they passed. We were also
amused with a Chinese puppet-shew which differs but little
from an English one. There are a distressed princess confined
in a castle, and a knight-errant, who, after fighting wild
beasts and dragons, sets her at liberty and marries her;
wedding-feasts, jousts, and tournaments. Besides these, there
was also a comic drama, in which some personages not unlike
punch and his wife, Bandemeer and Scaramouch performed
capital parts. This puppet-shew, we were told, properly
belongs to the ladies' apartments, but was sent out as
a particular compliment to entertain us; one of the performances
was exhibited with great applause from our conductors,
and I understand it is a favourite piece at court.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 18th September we again went to
court, in consequence of an invitation from the Emperor, to
see the Chinese comedy and other diversions given on occasion
of his birth-day. The comedy began at eight o'clock
and lasted till noon. The Emperor was seated on a throne,
opposite the stage, which projected a good deal into the
pit. The boxes were on each side without seats or divisions.
The women were placed above, behind the lattices,
so that they might enjoy the amusements of the theatre without
being observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soon after we came in, the Emperor sent for Sir George
Staunton and me to attend him, and told us, with great
condescension of manner, that we ought not to be surprised
to see a man of his age at the theatre, for that he seldom
came there except upon a very particular occasion like the
present, for that, considering the extent of his dominions
and the number of his subjects, he could spare but little time
for such amusements. I endeavoured, in the turn of my
answer, to lead him towards the subject of my embassy, but
he seemed not disposed to enter into it farther than by delivering
me a little box of old japan, in the bottom of which
were some pieces of agate and other stones much valued by
the Chinese and Tartars; and at the top a small book written
and painted by his own hand, which he desired me to present
to the king my master as a token of his friendship
saying, that the old box had been 800 years in his family. He,
at the same time, gave me a book for myself also written and
painted by him, together with several purses for Areca nut. He
likewise gave a purse of the same sort to Sir George Staunton,
and sent some small presents to the other gentlemen of the
embassy. After this several pieces of silk or porcelain, but
seemingly of no great value, were distributed among the Tartar
princes and chief courtiers, who appeared to receive them
with every possible demonstration of humility and gratitude.</p>

<p>"The theatrical entertainments consisted of great variety, both
tragical and comical; several distinct pieces were acted in succession,
though without any apparent connexion with one an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>other.
Some of them were historical, and others of pure
fancy, partly in <i>recitativo</i>, partly in singing, and partly in
plain speaking, without any accompaniment of instrumental
music, but abounding in battles, murders, and most of the
usual incidents of the drama. Last of all was the grand pantomime
which, from the approbation it met with, is, I presume,
considered as a first-rate effort of invention and ingenuity.
It seemed to me, as far as I could comprehend it,
to represent the marriage of the ocean and the earth. The
latter exhibited her various riches and productions, dragons,
and elephants, and tygers, and eagles, and ostriches, oaks
and pines, and other trees of different kinds. The ocean
was not behind hand, but poured forth on the stage the
wealth of his dominions, under the figures of whales and
dolphins, porpesses and leviathans, and other sea monsters,
besides ships, rocks, shells, spunges, and corals, all performed
by concealed actors, who were quite perfect in their parts,
and performed their characters to admiration. These two
marine and land regiments, after separately parading in a circular
procession for a considerable time, at last joined together
and, forming one body, came to the front of the stage
when, after a few evolutions, they opened to the right and
left, to give room for the whale, who seemed to be the commanding
officer, to waddle forward; and who, taking his
station exactly opposite to the Emperor's box, spouted out of
his mouth into the pit several tons of water, which quickly
disappeared through the perforations of the floor. This ejaculation
was received with the highest applause, and two or
three of the great men at my elbow desired me to take par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>ticular
notice of it; repeating, at the same time, '<i>Hao, kung
hao!</i>'&mdash;'<i>charming, delightful!</i>'</p>

<p>"A little before one o'clock in the afternoon we retired, and
at four we returned to court to see the evening's entertainments,
which were exhibited on the lawn, in front of the
great tent or pavilion, where we had been first presented to
the Emperor. He arrived very soon after us, mounted his
throne, and gave the signal to begin. We had now wrestling
and dancing, and tumbling and posture-making, which
appeared to us particularly awkward and clumsy, from the
performers being mostly dressed according to the Chinese
<i>costume</i>, one inseparable part of which is a pair of heavy
quilted boots with the soles of an inch thick. The wrestlers,
however, seemed to be pretty expert and afforded much diversion
to such as were admirers of the <i>Palæstra</i>.</p>

<p>"A boy climbed up a pole or bamboo thirty or forty feet
high, played several gambols, and balanced himself on the
top of it in various attitudes, but his performance fell far
short of what I have often met with in India of the same
kind.</p>

<p>"A fellow lay down on his back, and then raised his feet,
legs, and thighs from his middle, perpendicularly, so as
to form a right angle with his body. On the soles of his
feet was placed a large round empty jar, about four feet long
and from two and a half to three feet diameter. This he balanced
for some time, turning it round and round horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>tally,
till one of the spectators put a little boy into it, who,
after throwing himself into various postures at the mouth of
it, came out and sat on the top. He then stood up, then
fell flat upon his back, then shifted to his belly, and after
shewing a hundred tricks of that sort, jumped down upon
the ground and relieved his coadjutor.</p>

<p>"A man then came forward and after fastening three slender
sticks to each of his boots took six porcelain dishes of
about eighteen inches diameter, and balancing them separately
at the end of a little ivory rod, which he held in his
hand, and twirling them about for some time, put them one
after the other upon the points of the six bootsticks abovementioned,
they continuing to turn round all the while. He
then took two small sticks in his left hand, and put dishes
upon them in the same manner as upon the other, and also
one more upon the little finger of his right hand, so that he
had nine dishes annexed to him at once, all twirling together,
which in a few minutes he took off one by one and placed
them regularly on the ground, without the slightest interruption
or miscarriage.</p>

<p>"There were many other things of the same kind, but I
saw none at all comparable to the tumbling, rope-dancing,
wire-walking, and straw balancing of Sadler's-Wells;
neither did I observe any seats of equitation in the style of
Hughes's and Ashley's amphitheatres, although I had been
always told that the Tartars were remarkably skilful in the
instruction and discipline of their horses. Last of all were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the fire-works which, in some particulars, exceeded any
thing of the kind I had ever seen. In grandeur, magnificence,
and variety, they were, I own, inferior to the Chinese
fire-works we had seen at Batavia, but infinitely superior
in point of novelty, neatness, and ingenuity of contrivance.
One piece of machinery I greatly admired; a green chest of
five feet square was hoisted up by a pulley to the height of
fifty or sixty feet from the ground; the bottom was so constructed
as then suddenly to fall out, and make way for twenty
or thirty strings of lanterns inclosed in the box to descend
from it, unfolding themselves from one another by degrees
so as at last to form a collection of at least five hundred, each
having a light of a beautifully coloured flame burning brightly
within it. This devolution and developement of lanterns
(which appeared to me to be composed of gauze and paper)
were several times repeated, and every time exhibited a difference
of colour and figure. On each side was a correspondence
of smaller boxes, which opened in like manner as the
others, and let down an immense network of fire, with divisions
and compartments of various forms and dimensions,
round and square, hexagons, octagons and lozenges, which
shone like the brightest burnished copper, and flashed like
prismatic lightning, with every impulse of the wind. The
diversity of colours indeed with which the Chinese have the
secret of cloathing fire seems one of the chief merits of their
pyrotechny. The whole concluded with a volcano, or general
explosion and discharge of suns and stars, squibs, bouncers,
crackers, rockets, and grenadoes, which involved the
gardens for above an hour after in a cloud of intolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
smoke. Whilst these entertainments were going forward the
Emperor sent to us a variety of refreshments, all which,
as coming from him, the etiquette of the court required us
to partake of, although we had dined but a short time
before.</p>

<p>"However meanly we must think of the taste and delicacy
of the court of China, whose most refined amusements seem
to be chiefly such as I have now described, together with the
wretched dramas of the morning, yet it must be confessed,
that there was something grand and imposing in the general
effect that resulted from the whole <i>spectacle</i>. The Emperor
himself being seated in front upon his throne, and all his
great men and officers attending in their robes of ceremony,
and stationed on each side of him, some standing, some sitting,
some kneeling, and the guards and standard-bearers behind
them in incalculable numbers. A dead silence was rigidly
observed, not a syllable articulated, nor a laugh exploded
during the whole performance."</p>

<p>Such was the reception and the entertainment of the British
Embassador at the court of Gehol, in <i>Mantchoo</i> Tartary, during
the days of the festival of the Emperor's anniversary. I
now proceed to give some account of the manner in which the
Dutch Embassadors were received, and the entertainments that
took place on the occasion of the festival of the new year, as
related in the manuscript journal above alluded to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>This journalist observes that, on approaching the capital of
the empire, they were not a little astonished to find that the
farther they advanced the more miserable and poor was the apparent
condition of the people, and the face of the country;
the clay-built huts and those of ill-burnt bricks were crumbling
to dust; the temples were in ruins, the earthen gods were
demolished, and their fragments strewed on the ground; and
the district was thinly inhabited. The following day they entered
Pekin but were turned out again to take up their lodgings
in the suburbs, in a sort of stable. From this place they were ordered
to proceed to the palace in their old travelling dresses, as
their baggage was not yet arrived. They were drawn in small
carts as crazy and as much out of order as their own dresses. Sitting
in the bottom of these carts, without any seats, they waited
within the walls of the palace a full hour, while an empty room
was swept out for their reception. Having remained here for
some time, a few planks were brought in, on which were arranged
a number of dishes of meat and fish, stewed in different
ways. Having finished their repast, thus ended their first day's
visit.</p>

<p>The following morning, at five o'clock, they were again
summoned to court, and ushered into a small room like that of
the preceding day, without any kind of furniture. The weather
being extremely cold, the thermometer many degrees below
the freezing point, the Embassadors prevailed on the people
to make a little fire which after some time was brought in, not
however without letting them understand that it was an extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>ordinary
mark of favour, it being the custom of the Chinese
to let all Embassadors wait the arrival of the Emperor in the
open air.</p>

<p>At length the Emperor made his appearance, carried by
eight men in a yellow sedan chair. On his approaching the
place where the Embassadors and their suite were standing, they
were directed by the master of the ceremonies to fall down on
their knees, and in this posture the first Embassador was instructed
to hold in both his hands, above his head, the gold
box in which was contained the letter for the Emperor: the
second minister then stepped forwards, and took the letter out
of his hands, which he delivered to the Emperor; and, at the
same time, they were directed to bow their heads nine times to
the ground, in token of acknowledgment for the gracious
reception they had met with from his Chinese Majesty.</p>

<p>This ceremony being ended, they were desired to follow the
Emperor's chair, which was carried to the side of a pond or
bason in the gardens, then frozen over. From this place the
Emperor was drawn on a sledge to a tent pitched on the ice,
whilst the Embassador and his suite were conducted into a dirty
hovel little better than a pig-stye, where they were desired to
sit down on a sort of bench built of stone and mortar; for, like
the room they were put into on a former day, it was destitute
of the least furniture; and they were told that something presently
would be brought for them to eat. On complaining to
their conductors that this was not the manner in which they
were accustomed to sit down to meat, and that they did not con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>ceive
such apartments to be at all suitable to the situation they
had the honour to hold, they were shortly afterwards conducted
into another room, little better however than the first,
but partly furnished with a few old chairs and tables. The
candlesticks were small blocks of wood, to which the candles
were fastened with a couple of nails. A few dishes of stewed
meat were served up and, as a great delicacy from the Emperor's
table, were brought in, without any dish, a pair of
stag's legs, which the Chinese threw down upon the naked
table; and for this mark of imperial favour they were required
to make the customary genuflections and nine prostrations.</p>

<p>Van Braam, in the journal which he or some of his friends
published in Paris, gives a curious account of the manner in
which they were fed from the Emperor's table: "La viande
consistait en un morceau de côtes sur lequelles il n'y avait
point un demi-pouce d'épaisseur d'une chair maigre, en un
petit os de l'épaule ou il n'y avait presque pas de chair, et en
quatre ou cinq autres ossemens fournis par le dos ou par les
pattes d'un mouton, et qui semblaient avoir été déja rongés.
Tout ce dégoûtant ensemble était sur un plat sale et paraissait
plutôt destiné à faire le regal d'un chien que le repas d'un
homme. En Holland le dernier des mendians recevrait, dans
un hôpital, une pittance plus propre, et cependant c'est une
marque d'honneur de la part d'un Empereur envers un Ambassadeur!
Peut-être mème etait-ce le reste du Prince, et dans
ce cas, selon l'opinion des Chinois, c'était le dernier terme
de la faveur, puisque nous pouvions achever l'os que sa Majesté
avait commencé à nettoyer."&mdash;"The meat consisted of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
small piece of the ribs, on which there was not half an inch
in thickness of lean flesh, and a small shoulder-blade almost
without any upon it; and in four or five other pieces of
bones from the back, or the legs of a sheep, which appeared
to have been already gnawed. The whole of this disgusting
mess was brought upon a dirty plate, and seemed much rather
intended to feast a dog than as a refreshment for man. In
Holland the meanest beggar would receive in an hospital his
allowance in a neater manner; and yet it was intended as a
mark of honour on the part of an Emperor towards an Embassador!
Perhaps it was even the remains of the Sovereign,
and in that case, according to the opinion of the Chinese, it
was the greatest possible act of favour, since we should then
have had an opportunity of finishing the bone which his Imperial
Majesty had begun to pick."</p>

<p>The Dutch gentlemen, equally disgusted with the meanness
and filthiness of the place, and with the pride and haughtiness
of the people, became now reconciled to the shabby appearance
of their old travelling dresses, which they began to consider as
fully good enough for the occasion.</p>

<p>Having finished their elegant repast, the amusements of the
day commenced on the ice. The Emperor made his appearance
in a sort of sledge, supported by the figures of four dragons.
This machine was moved about by several great Mandarins,
some dragging before, and others pushing behind. The
four principal ministers of state were also drawn upon the ice
in their sledges by inferior mandarins. Whole troops of civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and military officers soon appeared, some on sledges, some on
skaits, and others playing at football upon the ice, and he
that picked up the ball was rewarded by the Emperor. The
ball was then hung up in a kind of arch, and several mandarins
shot at it, in passing on skaits, with their bows and arrows.
Their skaits were cut off short under the heel, and the forepart
was turned up at right angles. Owing to this form, or to the
inexpertness of the skaiters, they could not stop themselves on
a sudden, but always tumbled one over the other whenever
they came near the edge of the ice, or towards the quarter where
the Emperor happened to be.</p>

<p>Leaving this place, they were carried through several narrow
streets, composed of miserable houses, forming a surprising
contrast with the proud walls of the palace. They were conducted
into a small room of one of these houses, almost void of
furniture, in order to pay their compliments to <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>,
the Collao, or prime minister, whom they found sitting cross-legged
on a truckle bedstead with cane bottom. Before this
creature of fortune, whose fate I shall have occasion hereafter
to notice, they were obliged to go down on their
knees. Like a true prime minister of China, he waved all
conversation that might lead towards business, talked to them
of the length of their journey, was astonished how they bore
the cold weather in such scanty clothing, and such like general
topics, which, in fact, signified nothing. From the first minister
they paid their visit to the second, whom they found lodged
in a similar manner; after which they returned to their mean
apartments in the city, more satisfied on a comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the miserable little chambers in which they had found the two
first ministers of this far-famed empire lodged, and the mean
hovels which they met with in the very center of the space shut
in by the walls of the imperial palace. The impressions that
the events and transactions of this day made on the minds of
the visitors were those of utter astonishment, on finding every
thing so very much the reverse of what they had been led to
expect.</p>

<p>The following day they were again drawn to court in their
little carts, before four o'clock in the morning, where, after
having waited about five hours in empty rooms, similar to
those of the preceding day, two or three great men (<i>Ta-gin</i>)
called upon them, but behaved towards them in a distant,
scornful, and haughty manner. "We had once more," observes
the Dutch journalist, from which I quote, "an occasion
to remark the surprising contrast of magnificence and meanness
in the buildings, and of pride and littleness in the persons
belonging to the imperial palace."</p>

<p>After these interviews, they were suffered to remain a day or
two at home; but on a bag of dried grapes being brought by a
mandarin from the Emperor, they were required to thank him
for the present with nine prostrations, as usual. Another time
a little pastry from the imperial kitchen demanded the same ceremony.
In short, whether at home or in the palace, the
Chinese were determined they should be kept in the constant
practice of the <i>koo-too</i>, or ceremony of genuflexion and prostration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 26th of January, the Embassadors received notice
that it was expected they should attend the procession of the
Emperor to the temple, where he was about to make an offering
to the God of Heaven and of earth. Having waited accordingly
by the road side, from three o'clock in the morning till
six, the weather dismally cold, Fahrenheit's thermometer standing
at 16° below the freezing point, the Emperor at length
passed in his chair, when they made the usual prostrations and
returned home.</p>

<p>The next morning they were again required to proceed to
the same place, and at the same early hour, to witness his return
and again to go through the usual ceremony.</p>

<p>On the 29th, they were again summoned to attend by the
road side to do homage before the Emperor, as he passed
them on his way to a pagoda or <i>Poo-ta-la</i>, a kind of temple or
monastery, where a great number of priests, clothed in yellow,
lived together in a state of celibacy; and here he made his
burnt-offerings. The mystical rates performed, presents were
brought out for the Embassador and suite, and also for the
<i>King</i> of <i>Holland</i>, consisting of little purses, flimsey silks, and
a coarse stuff somewhat similar to that known by seamen under
the name of <i>bunting</i>; and, in token of gratitude for this mark
of imperial kindness, they were directed again to <i>bow down
their heads to the ground</i>.</p>

<p>On the 30th, it was announced to them that the Emperor
intended to pay a visit to his palace at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
it would be necessary for them to follow him thither; after
having, as usual, paid their respects in the Chinese manner by
the road side as he passed.</p>

<p>On the 31st, they were conducted round the grounds of
<i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> by several Mandarins, and received great satisfaction
in viewing the vast variety of buildings, and the good
taste in which the gardens and pleasure grounds were laid out,
and which wore an agreeable aspect, even in the depth of winter.
In one of the buildings they saw the several presents deposited,
which had been carried the preceding year by the Earl
of Macartney. They were stowed away with no great care,
among many other articles, in all probability never more to see
the light of day. It seems the elegant carriages of Hatchett, that
were finished with so much care and objects of admiration
even in London, were here carelessly thrown behind one of
their mean and clumsy carts, to which they pretended to bestow
a preference. Capricious as children, the toy once played with
must be thrown aside and changed for something new; or, in
this instance, it would not be out of character to suppose, that
the two vehicles had designedly been placed together to point
out to Europeans of how little estimation the Chinese considered
their articles of ostentation, when they could perform the
same services by simpler and less expensive means.</p>

<p>The Dutch Embassadors and their suite were now to have a
specimen of the court entertainments, and the polite amusements
of this grand empire. They consisted chiefly of the contortions
of the human body, practiced by posture-masters; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
rope-dancing, and a sort of pantomimic performance, the principal
characters of which were men dressed in skins, and going
on all-fours, intended to represent wild beasts; and a parcel of
boys habited in the dresses of mandarins, who were to hunt
them. This extraordinary chace, and the music, and the rope-dancing,
put the Emperor into such good humour, that he rewarded
the performers very liberally. And the Empress and
the ladies, who were in an upper part of the house concealed
behind a sort of venetian blinds, appeared from their tittering
noise to be highly entertained. The whole concluded, though
in the middle of the day, with a variety of fire-works; and the
Chinese part of the company departed seemingly well satisfied
with these diversions.</p>

<p>An eclipse of the moon happening on the fourth of February
gave occasion to the Embassadors to enjoy a little rest at
home, though they were summoned to attend the palace at a
very early hour in the morning. The Emperor and his mandarins
were engaged the whole day in devoutly praying the
gods that the moon might not be eaten up by the great dragon
that was hovering about her. Recovered from their apprehensions,
an entertainment was given the following day, at which
the Embassadors were required to be present. After a number
of juggling tricks and infantine sports, a pantomime, intended
to be an exhibition of the battle of the dragon and the moon,
was represented before the full court. In this engagement two
or three hundred priests, bearing lanterns suspended at the ends
of long sticks, performed a variety of evolutions, dancing and
capering about, sometimes over the plain, and then over chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and tables, affording to his Imperial Majesty and to his courtiers
the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of February the Dutch Embassadors left
Pekin, having remained there thirty-six days, during which
they were scarcely allowed to have a single day's rest, but
were obliged, at the most unseasonable hours, in the depth of
winter, when the thermometer was seldom higher than 10 or
12 degrees below the freezing point, to dance attendance upon
the Emperor and the great officers of state, whenever they
might think fit to call upon them; and to submit to the degrading
ceremony of knocking the head nine times against the
ground, at least on thirty different occasions, and without having
the satisfaction of gaining by this unconditional compliance
any one earthly thing, beyond a compliment from the Emperor,
<i>that they went through their prostrations to admiration</i>!
And they were finally obliged to leave the capital without being
once allowed to speak on any kind of business, or even
asked a single question as to the nature of their mission, which,
indeed, the Chinese were determined to take for granted was
purely complimentary to their great Emperor.</p>

<p>The manuscript I quote from describes minutely all the pantomimic
performances, the tricks of conjurors and jugglers, and
the feats of posture-masters, but as they seem to be pretty much
of the same kind as were exhibited before the British Embassy
in Tartary, as described by Lord Macartney, I forbear to relate
them. Enough has been said to shew the taste of the court
in this respect, and the state of the drama in China.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>I suspect, however, that the amusements of the theatre have
in some degree degenerated at court since the time of the Tartar
conquest. Dancing, riding, wrestling, and posture-making,
are more congenial to the rude and unpolished Tartar than the
airs and dialogue of a regular drama, which is better suited to
the genius and spirit of the ceremonious and effeminate Chinese.
I am led to this observation from the very common custom
among the Chinese officers of state of having private theatres
in their houses, in which, instead of the juggling tricks above
mentioned, they occasionally entertain their guests with regular
dramatic performances. In the course of our journey through
the country and at Canton, we were entertained with a number
of exhibitions of this kind; and as "the purpose of playing,"
as our immortal bard has observed, "both at the first, and
now, was, and is, to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature,"
it may not be foreign to the present subject to take a brief notice
of such performances.</p>

<p>The subjects of the pieces exhibited are for the most part
historical, and relate generally to the transactions of remote
periods, in which cases the dresses are conformable to the ancient
<i>costume</i> of China. There are others, however, that represent
the Tartar conquest, but none built on historical events
subsequent to that period. But the ancient drama is preferred
by the critics. They have also comic pieces, in which there
is always a buffoon, whose grimaces and low jests, like those of
the buffoons in our own theatres, obtain from the audience the
greatest share of applause. The dialogue in all their dramas,
whether serious or comic, is conducted in a kind of mono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>tonous
recitative, sometimes however rising or sinking a few
tones, which are meant to be expressive of passionate or querulous
cadences. The speaker is interrupted at intervals by shrill
harsh music, generally of wind instruments, and the pauses are
invariably filled up with a loud crash, aided by the sonorous
and deafening gong, and sometimes by the kettle drum. An
air or song generally follows. Joy, grief, rage, despair, madness,
are all attempted to be expressed in song on the Chinese
stage. I am not sure that a vehement admirer of the Italian
opera might not take umbrage at the representation of a Chinese
drama, as it appears to be something so very like a burlesque on
that fashionable species of dramatic entertainment; nor is the
Chinese stage wanting in those vocal warblers, the nature of
whom, as we are told by the ingenious and very entertaining
Martin Sherlock, a French lady explained to her little inquisitive
daughter, by informing her, that there was the same difference
between them and men, as between an ox and a bull.
Such creatures are indeed more necessary to the Chinese theatre,
as the manners of the country prohibit women from appearing
in public.</p>

<p>The unity of action is so far preserved, that they have actually
no change of scene; but change of place must frequently be
supposed. To assist the imagination in this respect, their management
is whimsical enough. If it be necessary to send a general
on a distant expedition, he mounts a stick, takes two or
three turns round the stage, brandishes a little whip, and sings a
song; when this is ended, he stops short, and recommences
his recitative, when the journey is supposed to be performed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
The want of scenery is sometimes supplied by a very unclassical
figure, which, just the reverse of the <i>prosopopoeia</i> or personification
of grammarians, considers persons to represent things.
If, for instance, a walled city is to be stormed, a parcel of soldiers,
piling themselves on a heap across the stage, are supposed
to represent the wall over which the storming party is to
scramble. This puts one in mind of the shifts of Nick Bottom.
"Some man or other must present wall," and, "let
him have some plaister, or some lome, or some rough-cast
about him to signify wall."</p>

<p>The audience is never left in doubt as to the character which
is produced before it. Like the ancient Greek drama and, in
imitation thereof, all our old plays, the <i>dramatis personæ</i> introduce
themselves in appropriate speeches to the acquaintance
of the spectators.</p>

<p>As to the time of action, a single drama will sometimes include
the transactions of a whole century, or even of a dynasty
more than twice the length of that period; which, among other
absurdities, gave Voltaire occasion to compare what he thought
to be a literal translation of the <i>Orphan of the House of Tchao</i>,
"to those monstrous farces of Shakespear, which have been
called tragedies;" farces, however, which will continue to
be read by those who understand them, which <i>he</i> did not, with
heartfelt emotion and delight, when his <i>Orphan of China</i> shall
have sunk into the neglect even of his own admiring countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>In this miserable composition of <i>Father Prémare</i>, for it can
scarcely be called a translation, there is neither diction, nor
sentiment, nor character; it is a mere tissue of unnatural, or
at least very improbable events, fit only for the amusement of
children, and not capable of raising one single passion, but
that of contempt for the taste of those who could express an
admiration of such a composition. The denouement of the
piece is materially assisted by means of a dog: but this part of
the story is told, and not exhibited; the Chinese taste not being
quite so depraved, in this instance, as to admit the performance
of a four-footed animal on the stage.</p>

<p>This drama, with ninety-nine others, published together in
one work, are considered as the classical stock-pieces of the
Chinese stage; but like ourselves, they complain that a depraved
taste prevails for modern productions very inferior to those of
ancient date. It is certainly true, that every sort of ribaldry
and obscenity are encouraged on the Chinese stage at the present
day. A set of players of a superior kind travel occasionally
from Nankin to Canton; at the latter of which cities, it seems,
they meet with considerable encouragement from the Hong
merchants, and other wealthy inhabitants. At these exhibitions
the English are sometimes present. The subject and the conduct
of one of their stock pieces, which being a great favourite
is frequently repeated, are so remarkable, that I cannot forbear
taking some notice of it. A woman being tempted to murder
her husband performs the act whilst he is asleep, by striking a
small hatchet into his forehead. He appears on the stage with
a large gash just above the eyes, out of which issues a prodigious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
effusion of blood, reels about for some time, bemoaning his lamentable
fate in a song, till exhausted by loss of blood, he
falls, and dies. The woman is seized, brought before a magistrate,
and condemned to be flayed alive. The sentence is
put in execution; and, in the following act, she appears upon
the stage not only naked, but completely excoriated. The thin
wrapper with which the creature (an eunuch) is covered, who
sustains the part, is stretched so tight about the body, and so
well painted, as to represent the disgusting object of a human
being deprived of its skin; and in this condition the character
sings or, more properly speaking, whines nearly half an hour
on the stage, to excite the compassion of three infernal or malignant
spirits who, like Æacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus,
sit in judgment on her future destiny. I have been informed
that it is scarcely possible to conceive a more obscene, indelicate,
and disgusting object, than this favourite exhibition, which, if
intended "to hold the mirror up to nature," it is to nature in
its most gross, rude, and uncivilized state, ill-agreeing with the
boasted morality, high polish, refined delicacy, and ceremonious
exterior of the Chinese nation; but it tends, among other
parts of their real conduct in life, to strengthen an observation
I have already made with regard to their filial piety, and which,
with few exceptions, may perhaps be extended to most of their
civil and moral institutions, "that they exist more in state
maxims, than in the minds of the people." As, however, a
Chinese might be led to make similar reflexions on the exhibition
of Harlequin Skeleton, and those numerous representations
that of late years have crept upon our own stage, where ghosts,
hobgoblins, and bleeding statues are called in aid of the <i>spectacle</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
I should hesitate to draw any general conclusion, with regard to
their taste, from the particular exhibition of a woman flayed
alive, were they not in the constant practice of performing
other pieces that, in point of immorality and obscenity, are still
infinitely worse; so vulgarly indelicate and so filthy, that the
European part of the audience is sometimes compelled by disgust
to leave the theatre. These are such as will not bear description,
nor do I know to what scenic representations they
can with propriety be compared, unless to those gross indecencies
of Theodora, which Procopius has described to have
been exhibited on the Roman stage, in the reign of Justinian<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
The people who encourage them must be sunk very deep in intellectual
grossness, and have totally lost sight of all decency.
These and similar scenes may be considered among the ill effects
of excluding women from their due share of influence in society.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to compliment the court of Pekin on
the elegance and refinement of its entertainments, but at the
expence of truth and reason. Those of Tartar origin will no
more bear a comparison with the noble contests of strength and
agility displayed by the old hardy Romans in the Circensian
games, than the regular drama of the Chinese will admit of being
measured by the softer, but more refined and rational amusements
of a similar kind in Europe. It is true the scenic representations
in the decline of the Roman empire, as they are described
to us, appear to have been as rude and barbarous as
those of the Chinese. They began by exhibiting in their vast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>amphitheatre the rare and wonderful productions of nature.
Forests enlivened with innumerable birds; caverns pouring forth
lions, and tygers, and panthers, and other beasts of prey;
plains covered with the elephant, the rhinosceros, the zebra,
the ostrich, and other curious animals, which the wilds of
Africa furnished, were all brought together within the circuit
of the <i>arena</i>. Not satisfied with the rich productions of the
earth, the sea must also become tributary to their amusements.
The arena was convertible into a sheet of water; and, at length,
the two elements concluding a marriage, as on the Chinese
theatre, produced a race of monsters which, according to the
Latin poet's<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> description, might vie with those of China.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 30%:">
<div class="poem" style="margin-left: -1em;">
"Non solum nobus sylvestria cernere monstra<br />
Contigit, æquoreos ego cum certantibus ursis<br />
Spectavi vitulos, et equorum nomine dignum<br />
Sed difforme genus."&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
Where Sylvan monsters not alone appear,<br />
But sea-cows struggle with the shaggy bear,<br />
And horses of the deep, a shapeless race.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div></div>

<p>In short, the greater part of the amusements of the Chinese
are, at the present day, of a nature so very puerile, or so gross
and vulgar, that the tricks and the puppet-shews which are
occasionally exhibited in a common fair of one of the country
towns of England, may be considered as comparatively polished,
interesting, and rational. In slight-of-hand, in posture-making,
rope-dancing, riding, and athletic exercises, they are
much inferior to Europeans; but in the variety of their fire-works
they, perhaps, may carry the palm against the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>world. In every other respect the amusements of the capital
of China appear to be of a low and trifling nature, neither suited
to the affected gravity of the government nor to the generally
supposed state of civilization among the people.</p>

<p>The old Emperor, as he observed to Lord Macartney, seldom
partook of such amusements. Considering, indeed, all the circumstances
connected with the reign of the present dynasty on
the throne, the government of an empire of such vast magnitude,
stored with an almost incalculable population, must necessarily
be a task of inconceivable vigilance and toil; a task
that must have required all the time, the talents, and the attention
of the four sovereigns to ensure the brilliant and unparalleled
successes that have distinguished their long reign. <i>Tchien
Lung</i>, at the age of eighty-three, was so little afflicted with
the infirmities of age, that he had all the appearance and activity
of a hale man of sixty. His eye was dark, quick, and penetrating,
his nose rather aquiline, and his complexion, even at
this advanced age, was florid. His height I should suppose to be
about five feet ten inches, and he was perfectly upright.
Though neither corpulent nor muscular at eighty-three, it was
not difficult to perceive that he once had possessed great bodily
strength. He always enjoyed a vigorous constitution, which
the regularity of his life did not impair. Like all the Mantchoo
Tartars he was fond of hunting, an exercise that during
the summer months he never neglected. He had the reputation
of being an expert bowman, and inferior only in drawing this
weapon to his grandfather <i>Caung-shee</i>, who boasts, in his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
will, that he drew a bow of the weight or strength of one hundred
and fifty pounds.</p>

<p>Nor were the faculties of his mind less active, or less powerful,
than those of his body. As prompt in conceiving as resolute
in executing his plans of conquest, he seemed to command
success. Kind and charitable, as on all occasions he
shewed himself to his subjects, by remitting the taxes, and
administering relief in seasons of distress, he was no less vindictive
and relentless to his enemies. Impatient of restraint or reverses,
he has sometimes been led to act with injustice, and to
punish with too great severity. His irascible temper was once
the cause of a severe and lasting affliction to himself, and the
circumstances connected with it are said to have produced a
gloom and melancholy on his mind which never entirely forsook
him. About the middle part of his reign, he made a circuit
through the heart of his empire. At <i>Sau-tchoo-foo</i>, a city
that is celebrated for its beautiful ladies which, being purchased
when infants, are educated there for sale to the opulent, he was
captivated with a girl of extraordinary beauty and talents, whom
he intended to carry back with him to his capital. The Empress,
by means of an eunuch, was made acquainted with his
new amour, and dreading his future neglect, her spirits were
depressed to such a degree, that a few days after receiving the intelligence
she put an end to her existence with a cord. The Emperor,
on hearing this melancholy news, was greatly distressed
and repaired without delay to Pekin. One of his sons, a very
amiable youth, fearful of incurring his father's displeasure,
had entertained some doubts whether it would be most proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to appear before him in deep mourning for his mother, which
might be construed as an insult to the father, who had been the
cause of her death, or in his robes of ceremony, which would
be disrespectful to the memory of his deceased mother. In this
dilemma he consulted his schoolmaster, who, like a true
Chinese, advised him to put on both. He did so and, unfortunately
for him, covered the mourning with the ceremonial habit.
<i>Tchien-Lung</i>, whose affection had now returned for his deceased
Empress, and whose melancholy fate he was deeply lamenting,
on perceiving his son at his feet without mourning, was so
shocked and exasperated at the supposed want of filial duty
that, in the moment of rage, he gave him a violent kick in an
unfortunate place which, after his languishing a few days,
proved fatal.</p>

<p>None of his four surviving sons ever possessed any share of
his confidence or authority which, of late years, were wholly
bestowed on his first minister <i>Ho-chung-tong</i>. He had a due
sense of religious duties, which he regularly performed every
morning. Having made a vow at the early part of his reign
that, should it please heaven to grant him to govern his dominions
for a complete cycle, or sixty years, he would then retire,
and resign the throne to his successor, he religiously observed it
on the accomplishment of the event. The sincerity of his faith
may partly be inferred from the numerous and splendid temples
he built and endowed in different parts of oriental Tartary, of
which the <i>Poo-ta-la</i>, or convent of Budha at Gehol, is the most
magnificent. It is said indeed, from the circumstance of his
long and fortunate reign, he had, in his later years, entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
an idea, that the Lama, or Budha, or Fo, for they are all the
same personage, had condescended to become incarnate in his
person. "However wild and extravagant," observes Lord
Macartney, "such a conceit may be regarded, we know from
history how much even the best understandings may be perverted
by prosperity, and that human nature, not satisfied
with the good things of this world, sometimes wishes to anticipate
the condition and felicity of the next. If Alexander
scorned to own less than Jupiter Ammon for his father, if
many Roman Emperors extorted altars and sacrifices in their
lifetime, if, even in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, an English
nobleman<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> encouraged the belief of his descent from a swan,
and was complimented in a dedication upon his feathered
pedigree, a similar infatuation may be the less inexcusable in
<i>Kien-Long</i>, a monarch, the length and happiness of whose
reign, the unlimited obedience of whose incalculable number
of subjects, and the health and vigour of whose body, have
hitherto kept out of his view most of those circumstances
that are apt to remind other men of their misery and mortality."</p>

<p>Till his last illness he continued to rise at three o'clock in
the morning, both in winter and summer. He usually took some
cordial to fortify his stomach, and then repaired to his private
devotions at one of his temples. After this he read the dispatches
of his great officers, both civil and military, who from
their different stations were ordered to write to him directly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>and not to the tribunals as had usually been the case. About
seven he took his breakfast of tea, wines, and confectionary,
when he transacted business with the first minister, consulting
with, or directing, him in the weighty matters of state, previous
to their appearing in regular form before the respective departments
to which they belonged. He had then a kind of levee,
which was usually attended by the Collaos, or ministers, and
the presidents of the departments or public boards. At eleven
refreshments were again served up and, after business was over,
he either amused himself in the women's apartments, or walked
round his palace or gardens. Between three and four he usually
dined, after which he retired to his private rooms and employed
himself in reading or writing till bed-time, which was always
regulated by, and seldom later than, the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>He was fully persuaded that his uninterrupted health was chiefly
owing to his early retiring to rest, and early rising; an observation,
indeed, that in our country has grown into a maxim, and
maxims are generally grounded on truth. The late Lord Mansfield
made a point for many years of enquiring from all the
aged persons, that at any time appeared before him to give evidence,
into their particular mode of living, in order that he
might be able to form some general conclusion with regard to
the causes of their longevity. The result of his observations was,
that he could draw no inference from their intemperance or abstemiousness
with regard to diet or drinking, but that they
all agreed in one point, that of being early risers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tchien-Lung</i> resigned the throne of China to his fifteenth son,
the present <i>Kia-king</i>, in February 1796, having completed a
reign of sixty years; and he died in the month of February
1799, at the advanced age of eighty-nine years.</p>

<p>When the Tartars conquered China, they found all the great
offices of state filled by eunuchs, and the palace swarmed with
these creatures; the greater part was immediately displaced,
and other Chinese of talent and education were put into their
places. Having, however, adopted the laws and customs of
the conquered, it became necessary to keep up the usual establishment
of women in the palace, the inevitable consequence
of which was the retention of a certain number of eunuchs to
look after them. And they are at this moment as numerous,
perhaps, in all the palaces, as they were at the conquest, but
none of them are dignified with any office of trust or importance
in the state. They consider themselves, however, as elevated
far above the plebeian rank; and a bunch of keys or a
birch broom gives them all the airs and insolence of office.</p>

<p>Of these eunuchs there are two kinds. The one is so far
emasculated as never to have the consolation of being a father;
the other must submit to lose every trace of manhood. The
first are entrusted with the inspection and superintendance of
the buildings, gardens, and other works belonging to the imperial
palaces, which they are required to keep in order. The
<i>Rasibus</i>, as the missionaries call them, are admitted into the interior
of the palace. These creatures paint their faces, study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
their dress, and are as coquettish as the ladies, upon whom indeed
it is their chief business to attend. The greatest favourite
sleeps in the same room with the Emperor, to be ready to administer
to his wishes; and in this capacity he finds numberless
opportunities to prejudice his master against those for whom
he may have conceived a dislike; and instances are not wanting
where the first officers in the state have been disgraced by means
of these creatures.</p>

<p>They are equally detested and feared by the princes of the
blood who reside in the palace, by the court officers, and by
the missionaries in the employ of government. The latter find
it necessary to make frequent, and sometimes expensive, presents
to those in particular about the person of his Imperial Majesty.
Should any of these gentlemen happen to carry about
with him a watch, snuff-box, or other trinket, which the
eunuch condescends to admire, there is no alternative; the missionary
takes the hint, and begs his acceptance of it, knowing
very well that the only way to preserve his friendship is to
share with him his property. An omission of this piece of civility
has been productive of great injury to the European.
The gentleman who regulates and keeps in order the several
pieces of clock-work in the palace assured me, that the old
eunuch, who was entrusted with the keys of the rooms, used
to go in by night and purposely derange and break the machinery,
that he might be put to the trouble and expence of
repairing it. This happened to him so often that, at length,
he became acquainted with the secret of applying the proper
preventive, which although expensive was still less vexatious than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the constant reparation of the mischief done to the articles of
which he had the superintendance.</p>

<p>The Chinese eunuchs are addicted to all the vices that distinguish
these creatures in other countries. There is scarcely one
about the palace, whether of the class of porters and sweepers,
or of that which is qualified for the inner apartments, but have
women in their lodgings, who are generally the daughters of
poor people, from whom they are purchased, and are consequently
considered as their slaves. It is difficult to conceive a
condition in life more humiliating, or more deplorable, than that
of a female slave to an eunuch; but happily for such females, in
this country the mental powers are not very active. Several
of the missionaries assured me of the truth of this fact, which
indeed I have strong reasons for believing even of the <i>Rasibus</i>.
The keeper of the hall of audience once took me to his lodgings,
but on coming to the door he desired me to wait till he
had made some arrangements within; the meaning of which
was, until he had removed his lady out of the way; nor was
he in the least displeased at my hinting this to him. Being
one of the favourite attendants of the ladies of the court, he
was of course a <i>black eunuch</i>. He was the most capricious creature
in the world; being sometimes extremely civil and communicative,
sometimes sullen, and not deigning to open his
lips: and whenever he took it into his head to be offended, he
was sure to practice some little revenge. I fancy he was clerk
of the kitchen, for the quality and the quantity of our dinner
generally depended on the state of his humour. When the report
of the Embassador's making conditions with regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ceremony of introduction first reached <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, he was
more than usually peevish, and conceived, as he thought, a
notable piece of revenge. Some pains had been taken to arrange
the presents in such a manner in the great hall as to fill
the room well, and set them off to the best advantage. The
old creature, determined to give us additional trouble and to
break through the arrangement that had been made, desired
that the whole might be placed at one end of the room. On
my objecting to this he pretended to have received the Emperor's
order, and that at all events it must be obeyed; and the
reason he assigned for the change was, "that his Majesty might
see them at once from his throne, without being at the trouble
of turning his head."</p>

<p>The great number of these creatures about the palace of
<i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> made my residence there extremely disagreeable.
They seemed, indeed, to be placed as spies on our conduct.
If I attempted to move ever so little beyond the court of our
apartments, I was sure of being watched and pursued by some
of them; to persist in my walk would have thrown the whole
palace in an uproar. I one day happened inadvertently to
stray through a thicket, which it seems led towards the apartments
of the ladies, but I had not proceeded far before I heard
several squalling voices in the thicket, which I soon recognised
to be those of eunuchs. They had run themselves out of
breath in seeking me, and my old friend of the kitchen was
not to be pacified for putting him to the hazard, as he pretended,
of losing his head by my imprudence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The eunuchs and the women are the only companions of
the Emperor in his leisure hours: of the latter, one only has
the rank of Empress, after whom are two Queens and their
numerous attendants, which constitute the second class of the
establishment; and the third consists of six Queens, and their attendants.
To these three ranks of his wives are attached one
hundred ladies, who are usually called his concubines, though
they are as much a legal part of his establishment as the others.
They would seem to be of the same description, and to hold the
same rank as the handmaids of the ancient Israelites. Their
children are all considered as branches of the Imperial family,
but the preference to the succession is generally given to the
male issue of the first Empress, provided there should be any.
This however is entirely a matter of choice, the Emperor having
an uncontrouled power of nominating his successor, either
in his own family or out of it. The daughters are usually married
to Tartar princes, and other Tartars of distinction, but
rarely, if ever, to a Chinese.</p>

<p>On the accession of a new Emperor, men of the first rank
and situation in the empire consider themselves as highly honoured
and extremely fortunate, if the graces of their daughters
should prove sufficient to provide them a place in the list
of his concubines; in which case, like the nuns in some countries
of Europe, they are doomed for ever to reside within the
walls of the palace. Such a fate, however, being common in
China in a certain degree to all women-kind, is less to be deplored
than the similar lot of those in Europe, where one sex
is supposed to be entitled to an equal degree of liberty with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the other; and as the custom of China authorizes the sale of all
young women by their parents or relations to men they never
saw, and without their consent previously obtained, there can
be no hardship in consigning them over to the arms of the prince;
nor is any disgrace attached to the condition of a concubine,
where every marriage is a legal prostitution. At the death of the
sovereign all his women are removed to a separate building,
called by a term which, divested of its metaphor, implies the
<i>Palace of Chastity</i>, where they are doomed to reside during the
remainder of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">f</span> no traces remained, nor any authorities could be produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of the antiquity of the Chinese nation, except the written character
of their language, this alone would be sufficient to decide
that point in its favour. There is so much originality in this
language, and such a great and essential difference between it
and that of any other nation not immediately derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Chinese, that not the most distant degree of affinity can be discovered,
either with regard to the form of the character, the
system on which it is constructed, or the idiom, with any other
known language upon the face of the globe. Authors, however,
and some of high reputation, have been led to suppose
that, in the Chinese character, they could trace some relation
to those hieroglyphical or sacred inscriptions found among the
remains of the ancient Egyptians; others have considered it to
be a modification of hieroglyphic writing, and that each character
was the symbol or comprehensive form of the idea it was
meant to express, or, in other words, an abstract delineation of
the object intended to be represented. To strengthen such an
opinion, they have ingeniously selected a few instances where,
by adding to one part, and curtailing another, changing a
straight line into a curved one, or a square into a circle, something
might be made out that approached to the picture, or the
object of the idea conveyed by the character as, for example,
the character <ins title="tián">&#30000;</ins>, representing <i>a cultivated piece of ground</i>,
they supposed to be the picture of an inclosure, turned up in
ridges; yet it so happens that, in this country, there are no inclosures;
the character, <ins title="k&#466;u">&#21475;</ins> a <i>mouth</i>, has been considered by
them as a very close resemblance of that object; <ins title="shàng">&#19978;</ins> and <ins title="xià">&#19979;</ins>
<i>above</i> and <i>below</i>, distinctly marked these points of position; the
character <ins title="rén">&#20154;</ins>, signifying <i>man</i>, is, according to their opinion,
obviously an abbreviated representation of the human
figure; yet the very same character, with an additional line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
across, thus <ins title="dà">&#22823;</ins>, which by the way approaches nearer to
the human figure, having now arms as well as legs, signifies
the abstract quality <i>great</i>; and with a second line thus <ins title="ti&#257;n">&#22825;</ins>
the material or visible <i>heaven</i>, between either of which and
<i>man</i> it would be no easy task to find out the analogy; and still
less so to trace an affinity between any of them, and <ins title="qu&#462;n">&#29356;</ins>
which signifies <i>a dog</i>.</p>

<p>It is true certain ancient characters are still extant, in which
a rude representation of the image is employed; as for instance,
a circle for the sun, and a crescent for the moon, but these appear
to have been used only as abbreviations, in the same manner
as these objects are still characterized in our almanacks, and
in our astronomical calculations. Thus also the <i>kingdom of
China</i> is designed by a square, with a vertical line drawn through
the middle, in conformity perhaps with their ideas of the earth
being a square, and China placed in its center; so far these may
be considered as symbols of the objects intended to be represented.
So, also, the numerals one, two, three, being designed
by <ins title="y&#299;">&#19968;</ins> <ins title="èr">&#20108;</ins> <ins title="s&#257;n">&#19977;</ins>, would naturally suggest themselves as being
fully as convenient for the purpose, and perhaps more so than
any other; and where the first series of numerals ended, which
according to the universal custom of counting by the fingers
was at <i>ten</i>, the very act of placing the index of the right hand
on the little finger of the left would suggest the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
vertical cross <ins title="shí">&#21313;</ins> as the symbol or representation of the number
ten.</p>

<p>I cannot avoid taking notice in this place of a publication of
Doctor Hager, which he calls an "<i>Explanation of the Elementary
Characters of the Chinese</i>." In this work he has advanced
a most extraordinary argument to prove an analogy between the
ancient Romans and the Chinese, from the resemblance which
he has fancied to exist between the numeral characters and the
numeral sounds made use of by those two nations. The Romans,
he observes, expressed their numerals one, two, three, by
a corresponding number of vertical strokes I. II. III. which the
Chinese place horizontally  <ins title="y&#299;">&#19968;</ins> <ins title="èr">&#20108;</ins> <ins title="s&#257;n">&#19977;</ins>. The Romans designed
the number ten by an oblique cross <a name="X" id="X"></a>X, and the Chinese by a
vertical one <ins title="shí">&#21313;</ins>. This resemblance in the forming of their numerals,
so simple and natural that almost all nations have
adopted it, is surely too slight a coincidence for concluding,
that the people who use them must necessarily, at some period
or other, have had communication together. The Doctor
however seems to think so, and proceeds to observe, that the
three principal Roman cyphers, I. V. X. or one, five and ten,
are denoted in the Chinese language by the same sounds that
they express in the Roman alphabet. This remark, although
ingenious, is not correct. <i>One</i> and <i>five</i>, it is true, are expressed
in the Chinese language by the <i>y</i> and <i>ou</i> of the French, which
it may be presumed, were the sounds that the letters I. and V.
obtained in the ancient Roman alphabet; but with regard to
the <i>ten</i>, or X, which, he says, the Chinese pronounce <i>xe</i>, he is
entirely mistaken, the Chinese word for <i>ten</i> in Pekin being <i>shee</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and in Canton <i>shap</i>. This error the Doctor appears to have
been led into by consulting some vocabulary in the Chinese and
Portuguese languages; in the latter of which the letter X is
pronounced like our <i>sh</i>. But admitting, in its fullest extent,
the resemblance of some of the numerals used by the two nations,
in the shape of the character, and of others in the sound,
it certainly cannot be assumed to prove any thing beyond a
mere accidental coincidence.</p>

<p>The earliest accounts of China, after the doubling of the Cape
of Good Hope, being written by Portuguese missionaries, and
the Chinese proper names still remaining to be spelt in the letters
of that alphabet, have led several etymologists into great
errors, not only with regard to the letter X, but more particularly
in the <i>m</i> final, and the <i>h</i> incipient, the former being pronounced
<i>ng</i>, and the latter with a strong aspirate, as <i>sh</i>. Thus
the name of the second Emperor of the present dynasty is almost
universally written in Europe <i>Cam-hi</i>, whereas it is as
universally pronounced in China <i>Caung-shee</i>.</p>

<p>The learned Doctor seems to be still less happy in his next
conjecture, where he observes that, as the Romans expressed
their <i>five</i> by simply dividing the X, or ten, so also the ancient
character signifying <i>five</i> with the Chinese was X or ten between
two lines thus <img src="images/i240.png" width="20" height="20" alt="symbol" title="" /> indicating, as it were, that the number
ten was divided in two; the Doctor seems to have forgotten that
he has here placed his cross in the <i>Roman</i> form, and not as the
Chinese write it; and it is certainly a strange way of cutting a
thing in two, by enclosing it between two lines; but the learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
seldom baulk at an absurdity, when a system is to be established.
The Chinese character for five is <ins title="w&#468;">&#20116;</ins>.</p>

<p>Of all deductions, those drawn from etymological comparisons
are, perhaps, the most fallacious. Were these allowed to
have any weight, the Chinese spoken language is of such a nature,
that it would be no difficult task to point out its relationship
to that of every nation upon earth. Being entirely monosyllabic,
and each word ending in a vowel or a liquid, and
being, at the same time, deprived of the sounds of several letters
in our alphabet, it becomes necessarily incapable of supplying
any great number of distinct syllables. Three hundred are,
in fact, nearly as many as an European tongue can articulate,
or ear distinguish. It follows, of course, that the same sound
must have a great variety of significations. The syllable <i>ching</i>,
for example, is actually expressed by fifty-one different characters,
each having a different, unconnected, and opposite meaning;
but it would be the height of absurdity to attempt to prove
the coincidence of any other language with the Chinese, because
it might happen to possess a word something like the
sound of <i>ching</i>, which might also bear a signification not
very different from one of those fifty-one that it held in the
Chinese.</p>

<p>The Greek abounds with Chinese words. <ins title="kyôn">&#954;&#965;&#959;&#957;</ins>, a <i>dog</i>, is in
Chinese both <i>keou</i> and <i>keun</i>, expressive of the same animal; <ins title="eu">&#7952;&#965;</ins>,
<i>good</i>, is not very different from the Chinese <i>hau</i>, which signifies
the same quality; and the article <ins title="to">&#964;&#8056;</ins> is not far remote from <i>ta</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
<i>he</i>, or <i>that</i>. Both Greeks and Romans might recognise their first
personal pronoun <ins title="egô">&#8051;&#947;&#969;</ins> or <i>ego</i> in <i>go</i>, or as it is sometimes written <i>ngo</i>.
The Italian affirmative <i>si</i> is sufficiently near the Chinese <i>shee</i>, or <i>zee</i>,
expressing assent. The French <i>étang</i>, and the Chinese <i>tang</i>, a pond
or lake, are nearly the same, and their two negatives <i>pas</i> and <i>poo</i>
are not very remote. <i>Lex</i>, <i>loi</i>, <i>le</i>, <i>law</i>, compared with <i>leu</i>, <i>lee</i>,
<i>laws</i> and <i>institutes</i>, are examples of analogy that would be decisive
to the etymological inquirer. The English word <i>mien</i>, the countenance,
and the Chinese <i>mien</i>, expressing the same idea, are
nothing different, and we might be supposed to have taken our
<i>goose</i> from their <i>goo</i>. To <i>sing</i> is <i>chaung</i>, which comes very near
our <i>chaunt</i>. The Chinese call a cat <i>miau</i>, and so does the Hottentot.
The Malay word <i>to know</i> is <i>tau</i>, and the Chinese monosyllable
for the same verb is also <i>tau</i>, though in conversation they generally
use the compound <i>tchee-tau</i>, each of which separately have
nearly the same meaning. The Sumatrans have <i>mau</i> for mother,
the Chinese say <i>moo</i>. On grounds equally slight with
these have many attempts been made to form conclusions from
etymological comparisons. If I mistake not, the very ingenious
Mr. Bryant makes the word <i>gate</i> a derivative from the Indian
word <i>ghaut</i>, a pass between mountains. Surely this is going a
great deal too far for our little monosyllable. Might we not with as
great a degree of propriety fetch our <i>shallow</i> or <i>shoal</i> from China,
where <i>sha-loo</i> signifies a flat sand, occasionally covered with the
tide? A noted antiquarian has been led into some comical mistakes
in his attempt to establish a resemblance between the Chinese
and the Irish languages, frequently by his having considered
the letters of the continental alphabets, in which the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
vocabulary he consulted was written, to be pronounced in the
same manner as his own<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever degree of affinity may be discovered between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sounds of the Chinese language and those of other nations, their
written character has no analogy whatsoever, but is entirely
peculiar to itself. Neither the Egyptian inscriptions, nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
nail-headed characters, or monograms, found on the Babylonian
bricks, have any nearer resemblance to the Chinese than
the Hebrew letters have to the Sanscrit; the only analogy that
can be said to exist between them is, that of their being composed
of points and lines. Nor are any marks or traces of
alphabetic writing discoverable in the composition of the
Chinese character; and, if at any time, hieroglyphics have been
employed to convey ideas, they have long given way to a collection
of arbitrary signs settled by convention, and constructed
on a system, as regular and constant as the formation of sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in any of the European languages arises out of the alphabets
of those languages.</p>

<p>The history of the world affords abundant evidence that, in
the dawn of civilization, most nations endeavoured to fix and
to perpetuate ideas by painting the figures of the objects that
produced them. The Egyptian priesthood recorded the mysteries
of their religion in graphic emblems of this kind; and the
Mexicans, on the first arrival of the Spaniards, informed their
prince Montezuma of what was passing by painting their ideas
on a roll of cloth. There is no way so natural as this of expressing,
and conveying to the understanding of others, the images
that pass in the mind, without the help of speech. In the
course of the present voyage, an officer of artillery and myself
were dispatched to make observations on the small island of
<i>Collao</i>, near the coast of <i>Cochin-China</i>. In order to make the
natives comprehend our desire to procure some poultry, we
drew on paper the figure of a hen, and were immediately supplied
to the extent of our wants. One of the inhabitants taking
up the idea drew close behind the hen the figure of an egg,
and a nod of the head obtained us as many as we had occasion
for. The Bosjesmen Hottentots, the most wild and savage
race perhaps of human beings, are in the constant habit of
drawing, on the sides of caverns, the representations of the different
animals peculiar to the country. When I visited some
of those caverns I considered such drawings as the employment
of idle hours; but, on since reflecting that in almost all
such caverns are also to be seen the figures of Dutch boors (who
hunt these miserable creatures like wild beasts) in a variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
attitudes, some with guns in their hands, and others in the
act of firing upon their countrymen; waggons sometimes proceeding
and at others standing still, the oxen unyoked, and
the boors sleeping; and these representations generally followed
by a number of lines scored like so many tallies; I am inclined
to think they have adopted this method of informing their
companions of the number of their enemies, and the magnitude
of the danger. The animals represented were generally
such as were to be met with in the district where the drawings
appeared; this, to a people who subsist by the chace and by
plunder, might serve as another piece of important information.</p>

<p>The Chinese history, although it takes notice of the time
when they had no other method of keeping their records, except,
like the Peruvians, by knotting cords, makes no mention
of any hieroglyphical characters being used by them. If
such were actually the case, the remains of symbolical writing
would now be most discoverable in the radical, or elementary
characters, of which we shall presently have occasion to speak,
and especially in those which were employed to express some
of the most remarkable objects in nature. Out of the two hundred
and twelve, or thereabout, which constitute the number
of the radical signs, the following are a few of the most simple,
in none of which, in my opinion, does there appear to be the
least resemblance between the picture and the object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote" style="font-size: 100%; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
<p>&#20154;&nbsp; <i>gin</i>, man</p>

<p>&#21475;&nbsp; <i>koo</i>, a mouth</p>

<p>&#22303;&nbsp; <i>tee</i>, earth</p>

<p>&#23376;&nbsp; <i>tsé</i>, a son</p>

<p>&#33400;&nbsp; <i>tsau</i>, a plant</p>

<p>&#23665;&nbsp; <i>shan</i>, a mountain</p>

<p>&#24515;&nbsp; <i>sin</i>, a heart</p>

<p>&#25163;&nbsp; <i>shoo</i>, a hand</p>

<p>&#26041;&nbsp; <i>fang</i>, space, or a square of ground</p>

<p>&#26376;&nbsp; <i>yué</i>, the moon</p>

<p>&#26085;&nbsp; <i>jee</i>, the sun</p>

<p>&#26408;&nbsp; <i>moo</i>, a tree</p>

<p>&#27700;&nbsp; <i>swee</i>, water</p>

<p>&#28779;&nbsp; <i>ho</i>, fire</p>

<p>&#30707;&nbsp; <i>shee</i>, a stone.</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of the elementary characters are, if possible, still more
unlike the objects they represent. There seems, therefore, to
be no grounds for concluding that the Chinese ever made use of
hieroglyphics or, more properly speaking, that their present
character sprung out of hieroglyphics. They have a tradition,
which is universally believed, that their prince <i>Fo-shee</i> was the
inventor of the system upon which their written character is
formed, and which, without any material alteration, there is
every reason to suppose has continued in use to this day. To
<i>Fo-shee</i>, however, they ascribe the invention of almost every
thing they know, which has led Mr. Baillie ingeniously to conjecture
that <i>Fo-shee</i> must have been some foreigner who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
civilized China; as arts and sciences do not spring up and bear
fruit in the life of one man. Many changes in the form of characters
may have taken place from time to time, but the principle
on which they are constructed seems to have maintained its
ground. The redundancies of particular characters have been
removed for the sake of convenience; and the learned in their
epistolary writing have adopted a sort of running hand, in
which the form is so very materially altered, by rounding off
the angles, connecting some parts and wholly omitting others,
as to make it appear to a superficial observer a totally different
language. But I may venture to observe, that it has not only
not undergone any material alteration for more than two thousand
years, but that it has never borrowed a <i>character</i>, or a syllable,
from any other language that now exists. As a proof of
this, it may be mentioned, that every new article that has found
its way into China since its discovery to Europeans has acquired a
Chinese name, and entirely sunk that which it bore by the nation
who introduced it. The proper names even of countries, nations,
and individuals are changed, and assume new ones in
their language. Thus Europe is called <i>See-yang</i>, the western
country; Japan <i>Tung-yang</i>, the eastern country; India <i>Siau-see-yang</i>,
the little western country. The English are dignified
by the name of <i>Hung-mou</i>, or <i>Red-heads</i>, and the French, Spanish,
Portuguese, and others, who visit China, have each a
name in the language of the country totally distinct from that
they bear in Europe. This inflexibility in retaining the words
of their own poor language has frequently made me think,
that Doctor Johnson had the Chinese in his mind when, in
that inimitable piece of fine writing which prefaces his diction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>ary,
he made this remark: "The language most likely to continue
long without alteration, would be that of a nation
raised a little, and but a little, above barbarity, secluded
from strangers, and totally employed in procuring the conveniences
of life."</p>

<p>The invention of the Chinese character, although an effort
of genius, required far less powers of the mind than the discovery
of an alphabet; a discovery so sublime that, according to
the opinion of some, nothing less than a divine origin ought to
be ascribed to it. It may, however, be considered as the
nearest approximation to an universal character that has hitherto
been attempted by the learned and ingenious of any nation;
each character conveying at once to the eye, not only simple,
but the most combined ideas. The plan of our countryman,
Bishop Wilkins, for establishing an universal character is, in all
respects, so similar to that upon which the Chinese language is
constructed, that a reference to the former will be found to convey
a very competent idea of the nature of the latter. The
universal character of our countryman is, however, more systematic,
and more philosophical, than the plan of the Chinese
character.</p>

<p>Certain signs expressing simple objects or ideas may be considered
as the roots or primitives of this language. These are
few in number, not exceeding two hundred and twelve, one
of which, or its abbreviation, will be found to compose a part
of every character in the language; and may, therefore, be considered
as the <i>key</i> to the character into which it enters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
eye soon becomes accustomed to fix upon the particular key,
or root, of the most complicated characters, in some of which
are not fewer than sixty or seventy distinct lines and points.
The right line, the curved line, and a point are the rudiments
of all the characters. These, variously combined with one another,
have been extended from time to time, as occasion might
require, to nearly eighty thousand different characters.</p>

<p>To explain the manner in which their dictionaries are arranged
will serve to convey a correct notion of the nature of this
extraordinary language. All the two hundred and twelve roots
or keys are drawn fair and distinct on the head of the page,
beginning with the most simple, or that which contains the
fewest number of lines or points, and proceeding to the most
complicated; and on the margins of the page are marked the
numeral characters one, two, three, &amp;c. which signify, that
the <i>root</i> or <i>key</i> at the top will be found to be combined on that
page with one, two, three, &amp;c. lines or points. Suppose, for
example, a learner should meet with an unknown character, in
which he perceives that the simple sign expressing <i>water</i> is the
<i>key</i> or <i>root</i>, and that it contains, besides this root, <i>six</i> additional
points and lines. He immediately turns over his dictionary
to the place where the character <i>water</i> stands on the top
of the page, and proceeding with his eye directed to the margin,
until the numeral character <i>six</i> occurs, he will soon perceive
the one in question; for all the characters in the language,
belonging to the <i>root water</i>, and composed of <i>six</i> other
lines and points, will follow successively in this place. The
name or sound of the character is placed immediately after it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
expressed in such others as are supposed to be most familiar;
and, in the method made use of for conveying this information,
the Chinese have discovered some faint and very imperfect idea
of alphabetic writing, by splitting the monosyllabic sound into
a dissyllable, and again compressing the dissyllable into a simple
sound. One instance will serve to explain this method. Suppose
the name of the character under consideration to be <i>ping</i>.
If no single character be thought sufficiently simple to express
the sound <i>ping</i>, immediately after it will be placed two well-known
characters <i>pe</i> and <i>ing</i>; but, as every character in the language
has a monosyllabic sound, it will readily be concluded,
that <i>pe</i> and <i>ing</i>, when compressed into one syllable, must be pronounced
<i>ping</i>. After these, the meaning or explanation follows,
in the clearest and most easy characters that can be employed.</p>

<p>When, indeed, a considerable progress has been made in the
language, the general meaning of many of the characters may
be pretty nearly guessed at by the eye alone, as they will mostly
be found to have some reference, either immediate or remote,
though very often in a figurative sense, to the signification of
the <i>key</i> or <i>root</i>; in the same manner as in the classification of
objects in natural history, every species may be referred to its
proper genus. The signs, for instance, expressing the <i>hand</i>
and the <i>heart</i>, are two <i>roots</i>, and all the works of art, the different
trades and manufactures, arrange themselves under the
first, and all the passions, affections, and sentiments of the
mind under the latter. The root of an <i>unit</i> or <i>one</i> comprehends
all the characters expressive of unity, concord, harmony, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
like. Thus, if I observe a character compounded of the two
simple <i>roots</i>, <i>one</i> and <i>heart</i>, I have no difficulty in concluding
that its signification is <i>unanimity</i>, but, if the sign of a <i>negative</i>
should also appear in the same character, the meaning will be
reversed to <i>discord</i> or <i>dissention</i>, literally <i>not one heart</i>. Many
proper names of persons have the character signifying <i>man</i> for
their key or root, and all foreign names have the character
<i>mouth</i> or <i>voice</i> annexed, which shews at once that the character
is a proper name employed only to express sound without any
particular meaning.</p>

<p>Nor are these keys or roots, although sometimes placed on
the right of the character, sometimes on the left, now at the
top, and then at the bottom, so very difficult to be discovered
to a person who knows but a little of the language, as Doctor
Hager has imagined. This is by far the easiest part of the language.
The abbreviations in the compound characters, and
the figurative sense in which they are sometimes used, constitute
the difficulty, by the obscurity in which they are involved, and
the ambiguity to which they are liable.</p>

<p>The Doctor is equally unfortunate in the discovery which he
thinks he has made of a want of order in classing the elements
according to the number of lines they contain. The instances
he gives of such anomaly are in the two characters of
&#27597; <i>moo</i>, mother; and &#30000; <i>tien</i>, cultivated ground: the first
of which he is surprised to find among the elementary characters
of <i>four</i> lines, and the latter (which he asserts to be still
more simple) among those of <i>five</i>. The Chinese, however, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
not quite so much out of order as the Doctor seems to be out of
his province in attempting a critique on a language, of which he
really possesses a very superficial knowledge. The first character
&#27597; <i>moo</i> is composed of <img src="images/i254a.png" width="98" height="27" alt="strokes" title="" /> and the second
&#30000; <i>tien</i> of <img src="images/i254b.png" width="100" height="28" alt="strokes" title="" />; the one of four and the other
of five lines according to the arrangement of Chinese dictionaries,
and their elementary treatises.</p>

<p>Among the roots or primitives that most frequently occur
are those expressing the <i>hand</i>, <i>heart</i>, <i>mouth</i>, and the five elements,
<i>earth</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>fire</i>, <i>wood</i>, and <i>water</i>. <i>Man</i> is also a very
common root.</p>

<p>The composition of characters is capable of exercising a very
considerable degree of ingenuity, and the analysis of them is
extremely entertaining to a foreigner. As in a proposition of
Euclid it is necessary to go through the whole demonstration
before the figure to which it refers can be properly understood,
so, in the Chinese character, the sense of the several component
parts must first be known in order to comprehend the meaning
of the compound. To endeavour to recollect them without
this knowledge would be a laborious and almost impossible
effort of the mind. Indeed, after this knowledge is acquired,
the sense is sometimes so hid in metaphor, and in allusions to
particular customs or ways of thinking, that when all the component
parts of a character are well understood, the meaning
may yet remain in obscurity. It may not be difficult to conceive,
for instance, that in a figurative language, the union of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> might be employed to express any extraordinary
degree of <i>light</i> or <i>brilliancy</i>; but it would not so readily
occur, that the character <i>foo</i> or <i>happiness</i>, or <i>supreme felicity</i>,
should be designed by the union of the characters expressing a
spirit or demon, the number <i>one</i> or <i>unity</i>, a <i>mouth</i>, and a piece
of <i>cultivated ground</i>, thus <ins title="fú">&#31119;</ins>. This character in the Chinese
language is meant to convey the same idea as the word <i>comfort</i> does
in our own. The character implying the <i>middle</i> of any thing, annexed
to that of <i>heart</i>, was not inaptly employed to express <i>a very
dear friend</i>, nor that with the <i>heart</i> surmounted by a <i>negative</i>,
to imply <i>indifference</i>, <i>no heart</i>; but it is not so easy to assign
any reason why the character <i>ping</i>, signifying rank or order,
should be expressed by the character <i>mouth</i>, repeated thrice, and
placed like the three balls of a pawnbroker, thus <ins title="p&#464;n">&#21697;</ins>, or why
four of these mouths arranged as under, with the character <i>ta</i>, <i>great</i>,
in the center, should imply an instrument, or piece of mechanism.
<ins title="qì">&#22120;</ins>. Nor would it readily occur why the character &#30007; <i>nan</i>,
<i>masculine</i>, should be made up of <i>tien</i>, a <i>field</i>, and <i>lee</i>, <i>strength</i>,
unless from the idea that the <i>male sex</i> possesses <i>strength</i>, and
only can inherit <i>land</i>. But that a <i>smoothness</i> or <i>volubility</i> of
<i>speech</i> <ins title="jìn">&#21803;</ins> should be designed by <i>koo</i>, <i>mouth</i>, and <i>kin</i>, <i>gold</i>, we
can more easily conceive, as we apply the epithet <i>silver tongue</i>
pretty nearly on the same occasion.</p>

<p>If the Chinese had rigidly adhered to the ingenious and philosophical
mechanism they originally employed in the construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>tion
of their characters, it would be the most interesting of all
languages. But such is far from being the case. New characters
are daily constructed, in which convenience, rather than perspicuity,
has been consulted.</p>

<p>It will follow from what has been said, that every compounded
character is not only a word, but also a <i>definition</i>,
comprehending in visible marks its full explanation; but no
character, however compounded, can have more than a monosyllabic
sound, though each part when alone has a distinct
sound, as well as sense. Thus, "Happiness," though compounded
of four distinct characters, <i>shee</i>, a demon; <i>ye</i>, one;
<i>koo</i>, a mouth, and <i>tien</i>, a piece of cultivated ground, has only
the simple monosyllabic sound <i>foo</i>, which is unlike that of any
one of its compounds.</p>

<p>The sounds and various inflexions incidental to languages
in general, are not necessary to be attended to in the study of
the Chinese characters. They speak equally strong to a person
who is deaf and dumb, as the most copious language could do
to one in the full enjoyment of all his senses. It is a language
addressed entirely to the eye, and not to the ear. Just as a
piece of music laid before several persons of different nations of
Europe would be played by each in the same key, the same
measure, and the same air, so would the Chinese characters
be equally understood by the natives of Japan, Tunquin, and
Cochin-China; yet each would give them different names or
sounds, that would be wholly unintelligible to one another.
When, on the present voyage, we stopped at Pulo Condore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the inhabitants, being Cochin-Chinese, had no difficulty in corresponding,
by writing, with our Chinese interpreters, though
they could not interchange one intelligible word.</p>

<p>Although, with the assistance of a good dictionary and a tolerable
memory, a knowledge of such of the Chinese characters,
as most frequently occur, may be obtained by a foreigner; yet
the ambiguity to which they are liable, on account of the frequent
figurative expressions and substitution of metaphor for
the literal meaning, renders their best compositions extremely
obscure. Another, and not the least, difficulty to a learner of
this language arises from the abridgment of the characters for
the sake of convenience, by which the eye is deprived of the
chain that originally connected the component parts. In short,
it is a language where much is to be made out that is not expressed,
and particularly so in what is called fine writing; and
a thorough knowledge of it can only be acquired from a familiar
acquaintance with the manners, customs, habits, and opinions
of the people. Those missionaries even, who have resided in
the country the best part of their lives, and accepted employments
about the palace, are frequently at a loss in translating
and composing the official papers that are necessary to be made
out on the occasion of an European embassy.</p>

<p>It is, however, a matter of surprize that, after all that has
been published in Europe by the Jesuits of the grandeur, the
magnificence, the learning, and the philosophy of the Chinese,
so very few persons should have taken the trouble to make
themselves acquainted with the language of this extraordinary
nation. So little was a <i>professor</i> of Chinese, at Rome, versed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in the language he professed to know, that he is said<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to have
mistaken some characters found on a bust of Isis for Chinese,
which bust and the characters were afterwards proved to be the
work of a modern artist of Turin, made after his own fancy. In
Great Britain we have known still less of the Chinese language
and Chinese literature than on the continent. It is not many
years ago, that one of the small copper coins of China, stamped
in the reign, and with the name, of the late <i>Tchien-lung</i> (or as
he is usually called in the southern dialect of China <i>Kien-long</i>)
was picked up in a bog in Ireland, and being considered as a
great curiosity, was carried to an indefatigable antiquary, whose
researches have been of considerable use in investigating the ancient
history and language of that island. Not knowing the
Chinese character, nor their coin, it was natural enough for
him to compare them with some language with which he was
acquainted; and the conclusion he drew was, that the four following
characters on the face were ancient Syriac; and that
the reverse (which are Mantchoo letters) appeared to be astronomical,
or talismanic characters, of which he could give no
explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p><p>The Mantchoo Tartar characters of another coin he supposed
to signify <span class="gesperrt" style="letter-spacing: .1em; margin-right: -.1em; font-weight: normal;"><i>p u r</i></span>, which is construed into <i>sors</i>, or lot; and it
is concluded, that these coins must either have been imported
into Ireland by the Ph&oelig;nicians, or manufactured in the country;
in which case, the Irish must have had an oriental alphabet.
"In either case," it is observed, "these medals contribute
more to authenticate the ancient history of Ireland than
all the volumes that have been written on the subject."</p>

<p>I have noticed this circumstance, which is taken from the
<i>Collectanea Hibernica</i>, in order to shew how little is known of
the Chinese character and language among the learned, when
so good a scholar and eminent antiquary committed so great a
mistake.</p>

<p>The youth of China generally begin to study the language
when they are about six years of age. Their first employment
is to learn by name a certain number of easy characters, without
any regard to the signification, or without understanding
the meaning of one of them, consequently, without adding to
the mind one single idea, for five or six years, except that of
labour and difficulty. For the <i>name</i> of a character, it may be
recollected, has no reference whatsoever to its <i>meaning</i>. Thus
fifty-one different characters, of as many distinct significations,
have the same name of <i>ching</i>; and if ten or a dozen characters,
bearing the sound of <i>ching</i>, should occur in the same page,
the learner, in this stage of his education, is not instructed in the
several meanings; his object is to acquire the sound, but to
neglect the sense. I have been told, that a regular-bred scholar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
is required to get by heart a very large volume of the works
of Confucius so perfectly, that he may be able to turn to any
passage or sentence from hearing the sound of the characters
only, without his having one single idea of their signification.
The next step is to form the characters, commencing by tracing,
or going over, a certain number that are faintly drawn in
red ink. As soon as they are able to cover these with tolerable
accuracy, without deviating from the lines of the original,
they then endeavour to imitate them on fresh paper. These
operations employ at least four years more of their life. Thus,
a young man of fourteen or sixteen years of age, although he
may be able to write a great number of characters, for each of
which he can also give a name, yet, at the same time, he can
affix no distinct idea to any one of them. The contrary method
would appear advisable of teaching them first the signification
of the simple roots, and the analysis of the compound
characters, and afterwards the sounds, or, perhaps, to let the
one accompany the other.</p>

<p>Objections of a similar nature to those now mentioned
against the mode of Chinese education, have, it is true, been
frequently stated with regard to the plan of educating youths
in the public grammar schools of our own country; that some
of the most precious years of their lives, when the faculties
were in growing vigour, and the plastic mind most susceptible
of receiving and retaining impressions, are wasted in poring
over the metaphysics of a Latin Grammar, which they cannot
possibly comprehend; and in learning by heart a number of
declinations, conjugations, and syntax rules, which serve only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to puzzle and disgust, instead of affording instruction or amusement:
that the grammar, or philosophical part of a language, is
useful only for the niceties and perfection of that language, and
not a subject for boys. In all instances, perhaps, where the
language to be learned is made the common colloquial language
of the pupil, the objections stated against the use of the grammar
may have some weight. But as this is not the case with
regard to the Greek and Latin languages in Europe, nor to
the written character in China, which differs widely from the
colloquial, long experience may, perhaps, in both cases, have
led to the adoption of the most eligible method<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>But a youth of Europe has a very material advantage over
one of China, during the time in which he is said to be poring
over his Latin Grammar. He is in the daily habit of acquiring
new ideas, from his knowledge of other languages.
His mother-tongue supplies him with books, which he is able
to comprehend, and from which he derives both entertainment
and instruction. Without enumerating the great variety of these
that daily engage his attention, I deem it sufficient to observe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>that his Robinson Crusoe (the best book, with few exceptions,
that can be put into a boy's hand) shews the numberless difficulties
to which he is liable in the world, when the anxious
cares of his parents have ceased to watch over him; it is there
pointed out to him that, arduous as many undertakings may
appear to be, few are insurmountable; that the body and the
mind of man are furnished with resources which, by patience,
diligence, prudence, and reflexion, will enable him to overcome
the greatest difficulties, and escape the most imminent
dangers. His Tom Jones, however exceptionable in those
parts where human failings are represented under an amiable
and alluring dress, leaves, upon the whole, a lively impression
in favour of generosity and virtue, and seldom fails to excite
an indignant glow against perfidy, selfishness, and brutality.
The young Chinese has no such relief from his dry study of acquiring
the names and representations of things that to
him have as yet no meaning. He knows not a word of any language
but his own.</p>

<p>The last step in the education of a Chinese is to analyse the
characters, by the help of the dictionary, in the manner already
mentioned, so that he now first begins to comprehend the use
of the written character. Extracts from the works of their
famous philosopher <i>Cong-foo-tse</i> (the Confucius of the missionaries)
are generally put into his hands; beginning with those
that treat on moral subjects, in which are set forth, in short
sentences, the praises of virtue, and the odiousness of vice, with
rules of conduct to be observed in the world. The <i>eternal mean</i>,
in the style and manner of the maxims of Seneca, next follows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and the art of government, with an abridgment of the laws,
completes him for taking his first degree, which generally happens
when he has attained his twentieth year; but in order to
be qualified for any high employment, he must study at least
ten years longer.</p>

<p>From this view of the written character, and the mode of
education, it will readily occur, that little progress is likely to
be made in any of the speculative sciences; and more especially
as their assistance is not necessary to obtain the most elevated
situations in the government. The examinations to be passed
for the attainment of office are principally confined to the
knowledge of the language; and as far as this goes, they are
rigid to the utmost degree. The candidates are put into separate
apartments, having previously been searched, in order to
ascertain that they have no writing of any kind about them.
They are allowed nothing but pencils, ink, and paper, and within
a given time they are each to produce a theme on the subject
that shall be proposed to them. The excellence of the
composition, which is submitted to the examining officers, or
men of letters, depends chiefly on the following points.</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
<p>That every character be neatly and accurately made.</p>

<p>That each character be well chosen, and not in vulgar use.</p>

<p>That the same character do not occur twice in the same
composition.</p></div>

<p>The subject and the manner of treating it are of the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
consideration, but those on morality, or history, are generally
preferred. If the following story, as communicated by one of
the missionaries, and related, I believe, by the Abbé Grozier,
be true, there requires no further illustration of the state of literature
in China. "A candidate for preferment having inadvertently
made use of an abbreviation in writing the character
<i>ma</i> (which signifies a <i>horse</i>) had not only the mortification of
seeing his composition, very good in every other respect,
rejected solely on that account; but, at the same time, was
severely rallied by the censor, who, among other things,
asked him how he could possibly expect his horse to walk
without having all his legs!"</p>

<p>The construction of the colloquial, or spoken language, is
extremely simple. It admits of no inflexion of termination,
either in the verb, or in the noun, each word being the same
invariable monosyllable in number, in gender, in case, mood,
and tense; and, as most of these monosyllables begin with a
consonant and end with a vowel, except a few that terminate
in <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, or <i>ng</i>, the number of such sounds, or simple syllables,
is very limited. To an European they do not exceed three
hundred and fifty. But a Chinese, by early habit, has acquired
greater power over the organs of speech, and can so modulate
his voice as to give to the same monosyllable five or six distinct
tones of sound; so that he can utter at least twelve or thirteen
hundred radical words, which, with the compounds, are found
to be fully sufficient for expressing all his wants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>On this curious subject I am enabled to speak with great
accuracy, through the kindness of Sir George Staunton, to
whom, indeed, I am indebted for more information in this
work than I am allowed to acknowledge. From the best manuscript
Chinese dictionary in his possession, he has obligingly
taken the trouble to draw out the following abstract of all the
simple sounds, or words, in the Chinese language, together
with their inflexions or accentuations, by which they are extended
as far as any tongue can possibly articulate, or the
nicest ear discriminate. The first column shews all the initial
letters, or their powers in the language; the second, the
number of terminations, or the remaining part of the monosyllable
beside the initial; and the third, expresses the number
of monosyllabic sounds that may be given to each by inflexion,
or modulation of voice, and by making use of
aspirates.</p>

<p>So that in the whole colloquial language of China, an European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
may make out 342 simple monosyllabic sounds, which by
the help of aspirates, inflexions of voice, or accentuations, are
capable of being increased by a Chinese to 1331 words. And
as the written language is said to contain 80,000 characters, and
each character has a name, it will follow, that, on an average,
60 characters, of so many different significations, must necessarily
be called by the same monosyllabic name. Hence, a composition
if read would be totally unintelligible to the ear, and must
be seen to be understood. The monosyllabic sound assigned to
each charter is applied to so many different meanings, that
in its unconnected state it may be said to have no meaning
at all.</p>

<p>In the business of common life, the nice inflexions or modulations,
that are required to make out these thirteen hundred words,
may amply be expressed in about fifteen thousand characters, so
that each monosyllabic sound will, in this case, on an average,
admit of about twelve distinct significations. This recurrence
of the same words must necessarily cause great ambiguity in
conversation, and it frequently indeed leads to ridiculous mistakes,
especially by foreigners. Thus, a sober missionary, intending
to pass the night at a peasant's house, asked as he
thought for a <i>mat</i>, but was very much surprised on seeing his
host presenting him with a <i>young girl</i>; these two objects, so
very different from one another, being signified by two words
whose pronunciations are not distinguishable, and consequently
one or the other requires to be used with an adjunct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a source of daily amusement to our conductors, to
hear the <i>equivoques</i> we made in attempting to speak their
language. A Chinese, when the sense is doubtful, will draw
the character, or the root of it, in the air with his finger or
fan, by which he makes himself at once understood.</p>

<p>But as some of these monosyllabic words, as I have observed
of <i>ching</i>, have not less than fifty distinct significations, which
the nicest tones and inflexions, even of a Chinese voice, are not
able to discriminate, such words are generally converted into
compounds, by adding a second syllable, bearing some relative
sense to the first, by which the meaning is at once determined.
Among the significations, for instance, of the monosyllable <i>foo</i>
is that of <i>father</i>, to which, for the sake of distinction, as
<i>foo</i> has many significations beside that of father, they add the syllable
<i>chin</i>, implying <i>kindred</i>; thus, a Chinese in speaking of his
parents invariably says <i>foo-chin</i> for father, and <i>moo-chin</i>
for mother; but, in writing, the character of <i>chin</i> would be considered
as an unnecessary expletive, that of <i>foo</i> being very differently
made from any other called by the same name.</p>

<p>The grammar of this language may briefly be explained.
The noun, as observed, is indeclinable; the particles <i>te</i> or <i>tié</i>,
mark the genitive, and always follow the noun; <i>eu</i> the dative,
which it precedes, and <i>tung</i> or <i>tsung</i> the ablative, before which
they are also placed. As for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<div class="bump">Nom. <i>gai</i>       love.</div>

<div class="bump">Gen. <i>gai-te</i>    of love.</div>

<div class="bump">Dat. <i>eu-gai</i>    to love.</div>

<div class="bump">Acc. <i>gai</i> love.</div>

<div class="bump">Abl. <i>tung</i> or <i>tsung gai</i>, from or by love. And the same in the plural.</div>


<div class="pad"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Give me <i>your</i> book,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Keu go</i> <span class="sc">ne-te</span> <i>shoo</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Dear <i>to</i> men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Quei</i> <span class="smcap">eu</span> <i>jin</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Come you <i>with</i> him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Ne-lai</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">tung</span> <i>ta</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The adjective is also formed from the genitive of the noun as
<i>pai</i>, whiteness; <i>pai-tié</i> white; <i>je</i> heat; <i>je-tié</i> hot; <i>lee</i>, reason;
<i>lee-tié</i>, rational; <i>hau</i> goodness; <i>hau tié</i>, good. But when the
adjective precedes the noun, as it generally does, the particle <i>tié</i>
is omitted as,</p>

<div class="pad">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>hau jin</i>, a good man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>pai-ma</i>, a white horse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>je-swee</i>, hot water.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The plural of nouns is expressed by prefixing some word signifying
plurality, as <i>to-jin</i>, many men; <i>to-to jin</i>, a multitude of
men; <i>chung jin</i>, all men; and sometimes by a repetition of the
word as <i>jin-jin</i>, men.</p>

<p>Adjectives are compared by placing the particle <i>keng</i> before
the comparative, as</p>

<div class="pad">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>yeou</i>, soft; <i>keng yeou</i>, softer.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>hau</i>, good; <i>keng hau</i>, better.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">My book is <i>newer</i> than yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Go-te shoo</i> <span class="smcap">keng</span> <i>sin ne-te</i>.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The superlative is marked by various particles, sometimes preceding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and sometimes following, the adjective, and it is also
formed by repeating the positive, as</p>

<div class="pad">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>hau, hau tié</i>, very good.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>whang-whang-tié</i>, very yellow.</span>
</div>

<p>The personal pronouns are,</p>

<div class="pad">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>ngo</i> (nasal) or <i>go, ne,&nbsp;&nbsp;   ta,&nbsp; go-men, ne-men, ta-men.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">I,&nbsp;&nbsp; thou, he,&nbsp;  we,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ye,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they.</span>
</div>

<p>And they become possessives, in the same manner as nouns are
changed into adjectives, by the addition of <i>te</i> or <i>tié</i>, as</p>

<div class="pad">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>go-te, ne-te, ta-te, go-men-te, ne-men-te, ta-men-te.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">mine,&nbsp; thine,&nbsp; his,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theirs.</span>
</div>

<p>The verb has likewise neither conjugation nor inflection;
and the tenses, or times of action or passion, are limited to
three; the present, the past, and the future. The present is
signified simply by the verb, as <i>go lai</i>, I come; the past, is expressed
by the particle <i>leo</i>, as <i>go lai leo</i>, I did come, or I have
come; and the future is formed by placing the particle <i>yau</i> before
the verb, as <i>go yau lai</i>, I will come; or, when something
very determined is meant to be expressed, the compound
<i>yuen-y</i> precedes the verb, as <i>go yuen-y-lai</i>, I am determined to
come. It may be observed, however, that although these, and
other particles signifying the time and mode of action, are necessary
in common speech, yet, in fine writing, they are entirely
omitted, which is another cause of the obscurity and difficulty
that occur to strangers in the study of the Chinese
character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The two negatives <i>mo</i> and <i>poo</i>, are of great use in the spoken
language. The first is generally used with the verb <i>yeu</i> to
have, and always implies a want or deficiency, as, <i>mo yeu nai</i>,
there is no milk; <i>mo yeu tcha</i>, you can have no tea, I have no
tea, there is no tea, &amp;c. <i>Poo</i> is generally used to express qualities
of an opposite nature, as, <i>hau</i>, good, <i>poo hau</i>, bad; <i>je</i>,
hot; <i>poo je</i>, cold; <i>ta</i>, great; <i>poo ta</i>, little. The usual salutation
between friends is <i>hau-poo-hau</i>, well, or not well?</p>

<p>The limits I have prescribed for the present work will not allow
me to enter into a more detailed account of this singular language.
What has been said may serve to convey a general idea
of the written character, and the simple construction of the
spoken language. I shall now endeavour, in a few words, to
explain the nature and construction of the Mantchoo Tartar
character, which, if the present family continue on the throne
for a century longer, will, in all probability, supplant the
Chinese, or will at least become the court language. In the
enunciation it is full, sonorous, and far from being disagreeable,
more like the Greek than any of the oriental languages; and
it abounds with all those letters which the Chinese have rejected,
particularly with the letters B and R. It is alphabetic, or, more
properly speaking, syllabic, and the different parts of speech
are susceptible of expressing number, case, gender, time, modes
of action, passion, and other accidents, similar to those of European
languages. This is effected either by change of termination,
preposition, or interposition. The character is extremely
beautiful, and it is written, like the Chinese, in perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
columns, but beginning on the left side of the paper instead of
the right, as is the case in writing the former language.</p>

<p>The elements of the language are comprized in twelve classes
of simple sounds or monosyllables, from the different combinations
of which all the words of the Mantchoo language are
formed.</p>

<p>These classes are distinguished by the terminations.</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-size: 100%;"><p>The first class ends in a, e, i, o, u, pronounced exactly
as the Italian.</p>

<p>The second, in ai, ei, iei, oi, ui.</p>

<p>The third, in ar, er, ir, or, ur, air, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fourth, in an, en, in, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fifth, in ang, eng, ing, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The sixth, in ak, ek, ik, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The seventh, in as, es, is, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The eighth, in at, et, it, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The tenth, in au, eu, iu, ou.</p>

<p>The eleventh, in al, el, il, &amp;c.</p>

which being joined to these elementary terminations, generally
at the upper extremity, give all the monosyllabic sounds, and
the junction of these according to their various combinations
all the words in the Mantchoo language. One example will
be sufficient to shew the nature of such composition; thus the

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Of the state of their literature, and progress in science, I
have little to observe. The nature of the language will almost
itself determine these points. With respect to any branch of
polite literature, or speculative science, little improvement
seems to have been made in the last two thousand years. Indeed,
there are no works in the whole empire, modern or ancient,
that are so much esteemed, so much studied, and I may
perhaps add, so little comprehended, as the five classical books
collected and commented upon by their great philosopher
<i>Cong-foo-tse</i>, who lived about 450 years before the Christian
æra; and these certainly are very extraordinary productions
for the time in which they were written. These works and a
few writings of their favourite master, according to the annals
of the country, escaped the general destruction of books, when
the barbarous <i>She-whang-te</i> ordered all the monuments of
learning to be burnt, except such as treated of medicine and
agriculture, about 200 years before Christ, for the absurd purpose,
as they state, that he might be considered by posterity as
the first civilized Emperor which had governed China, and
that the records of its history might, by this mean artifice, appear
to commence with his reign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Admitting such an event to have happened which, however,
may be considered as doubtful, the supposition involves in it
this necessary consequence, that the stock of learning at that
time must have been very confined. It is scarcely possible,
otherwise, how one person, near the end of his reign, could
have contrived to assemble together all the works of art and
literature, dispersed through so large a tract of country and so
enlightened as it was then supposed to be. There were, besides,
other independent sovereigns in the country, over whom he
had little or no controul, so that it is very probable the commonwealth
of letters suffered no great loss by the burning of the
Chinese books. When the Caliph Omar commanded the Alexandrian
library to be destroyed, which the pride and the learning
of the Ptolemy family had collected from every part of the
world, literature sustained an irreparable loss; but, although the
tyrant had the power to consign to eternal oblivion the works
of science, yet he had no power over the principles upon which
these works were constructed. These principles had spread
themselves wide over the world. The expedition of Alexander
carried the learning of the Egyptians and the Greeks into
various countries of Asia, where they continued to flourish.
And when the tyranny and oppression of the seventh Ptolemy
(Physcon) forced the Alexandrians to abandon a city that was
perpetually streaming with the blood of its citizens, they found
an asylum in the Grecian states and in different parts of Asia.
And as this sanguinary tyrant, in the midst of his cruelties,
pretended and indeed shewed a fondness for literature, the
arts and the sciences flourished even in his reign: the migrations,
therefore, at this time, from the capital of Egypt, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of the greatest importance and use to those nations among whom
the refugees settled. Unluckily for China, the wild mountainous
forests towards the south, and the wide sandy deserts
to the north, that render any communication extremely difficult
between this empire and the rest of Asia, together with
their dislike for foreigners, seem, at this time, to have checked
the progress of those arts and sciences which had long flourished
in Europe and in Africa. Their history, at least, is silent as to
any communication with India, till a century nearly after the
commencement of the Christian æra, when the religion of Budha
found its way from Thibet into China.</p>

<p>Whether the burning of the works of the learned in China
did or did not happen, appears, as already observed, to admit of
some doubt; but the antiquity, and the authenticity, of the five
<i>king</i>, or classics, seem to be sufficiently established. And considering
the early periods in which they were written, they certainly
demonstrate a very superior degree of civilization. It has
been observed that, in this country, the arts, the sciences, and
literature, are not progressive; and the five <i>king</i> would lead
one to conclude, that they have rather even been retrograde than
stationary. The names of these works are:</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
<p>1. <i>Shoo-king.</i> A collection of records and annals of various
princes, commencing more than 2000 years before Christ.</p>

<p>2. <i>Shee-king.</i> Odes, sonnets, and maxims; most of them so
abundant in metaphor, and so obscure, that much of
the sense is to be made out by the translator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Ye-king.</i> The perfect and the broken lines of <i>Fo-shee</i>;
the most ancient relict in China, and perhaps the first
attempt at written language: now perfectly incomprehensible.</p>

<p>4. <i>Chung-choo.</i> Spring and autumn. The history of some of
the kings of <i>Loo</i>: the work principally of <i>Cong-foo-tse</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lee-kee.</i> Ceremonies and moral duties. A compilation of
<i>Cong-foo-tse</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The lines of <i>Fo-shee</i> puzzled even the great philosopher of
the country, who declared himself dissatisfied with all the explanations
of the commentators. The learned and ingenious
Leibnitz fancied he discovered in them a system of binary
arithmetic, by which all the operations and results of numbers
might be performed, with the help of two figures only, the
cypher or zero 0, and an unit 1, the former being considered as
the constant multiple of the latter, as 10 is of the unit. Thus
1 would stand for 1, 10 for two, 11 for three, 100 for four, and
so on. It is unnecessary to observe, with how many inconveniences
such a system would be attended when reduced to
practice. This discovery of the binary series, which the mathematician,
in all probability, considered only as a philosophical
plaything, was communicated to Father Bouvet the
Jesuit who, happening at that time to be engaged in decyphering
the lines of <i>Fo-shee</i>, caught the idea and in an extacy
of joy proclaimed to the world that Leibnitz had solved the
<i>Fo-sheean</i> riddle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The missionaries of the Romish church are so accustomed to
the mysteries with which their religion abounds, that every
thing they meet with, and do not understand, among a strange
people, is also resolved into a mystery. Thus, the following
figure, which the Chinese, in allusion to the regular lines described
on the back-shell of some of the tortoises, metaphorically
call the mystic tortoise, has been supposed by some of
these gentlemen to contain the most sublime doctrines of Chinese
philosophy; that they embrace a summary of all that is
perfect and imperfect, represent the numbers of heaven and
earth, and such like jargon, which, it obviously appears, is no
less unintelligible to themselves than to their readers.</p>

<p>These famous lines, supposed to be found on the back of a
tortoise, are the following:</p>


<div class="image">
<img src="images/i278.png" width="268" height="211" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Who does not perceive, at a single glance, in this figure the
common schoolboy's trick of the magic square, or placing the
nine digits so that they shall make the sum of fifteen every
way, thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/i279.jpg" width="84" height="85" alt="number square" title="" />
</div>


<p>and what are the perfect and imperfect numbers, but the odd
and even digits distinguished by open and close points? In like
manner, I am inclined to believe, the several ways of placing
these open and close points that occur in Chinese books are literally
nothing more than the different combinations of the
nine numerical figures, for which they are substituted.</p>

<p>Most of the other <i>king</i> have been translated, wholly or in
part, and published in France. It may be observed, however,
that all the Chinese writings, translated by the missionaries,
have undergone so great a change in their European dress, that
they ought rather to be looked upon as originals than translations.
It is true, a literal translation would be nonsense, but there is
a great difference between giving the meaning of an author,
and writing a commentary upon him. Sir William Jones observes
that the only method of doing justice to the poetical
compositions of the Asiatics, is to give first a verbal and then
a metrical version. The most barren subject, under his elegant
pen, becomes replete with beauties. The following stanza,
from one of the odes of the <i>Shee-king</i>, is an instance of this remark.
It is calculated to have been written about the age of
Homer; and it consists of fifteen characters.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 45%;">

</div></div>

<p>This is a fair translation, as no more expletives are inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
than such as were necessary to make up the sense, and it is thus
paraphrased by Sir William Jones.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"Gay child of Spring, the garden's queen,<br />
Yon peach-tree charms the roving fight;<br />
Its fragrant leaves how richly green!<br />
Its blossoms, how divinely bright!<br />
<br />

And placid joys around her spread."<br />
</div></div>

<p>The late Emperor <i>Kien-Long</i> was considered among the best
poets of modern times, and the most celebrated of his compositions
is an ode in praise of Tea, which has been painted on all
the teapots in the empire. The following is a verbal translation,
with such auxiliaries only as were necessary to make the sense
complete.</p>

<p>"On a slow fire set a tripod, whose colour and texture shew
its long use; fill it with clear snow water, boil it as long as
would be necessary to turn fish white, and crayfish red;
throw it upon the delicate leaves of choice tea, in a cup of
<i>yooé</i> (a particular sort of porcelain). Let it remain as long
as the vapour rises in a cloud, and leaves only a thin mist
floating on the surface. At your ease, drink this precious liquor,
which will chase away the five causes of trouble. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
can taste and feel, but not describe, the state of repose produced
by a liquor thus prepared."</p>

<p>He wrote, likewise, a long descriptive poem on the city and
country of Moukden, in Mantchoo Tartary, which has been
translated by some of the missionaries, and appears to possess
much more merit than his ode on tea, of which, however, it is
difficult to judge without a thorough knowledge of the language,
as the ode may owe its chief beauties and its fame more to the
choice of the characters than to the sounds, literal sense, or versification.
To an European the Chinese language appears to
have few elegancies: it wants all the little auxiliaries that add
grace and energy to those of Europe. In the Chinese the
beauty of an expression depends entirely on the choice of the
character, and not on any selection or arrangement of the
monosyllabic sounds. A character uniting a happy association
of ideas has the same effect upon the eye of the Chinese, as a
general theorem expressed in symbols has on a mathematician;
but in both cases a man must be learned to feel the beauties of
the concise expression. Even in speaking the language has
few expletives. "English good, Chinese better,"&mdash;"to-day
go, to-morrow come,"&mdash;"sea no bound, Kiang no bottom;"&mdash;"well,
not well;"&mdash;are modes of expression in which an European
will not find much elegance.</p>

<p>In addition to the defects of the language, there is another
reason why poetry is not likely ever to become a favourite pursuit,
or to be cultivated with success, among the Chinese. The
state of society we have seen to be such as entirely to exclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the passion of love. A man, in this country, marries only
from necessity, or for the sake of obtaining an heir to his property,
who may sacrifice to his manes, or because the maxims
of the government have made it disgraceful to remain in a state
of celibacy. The fine sentiments that arise from the mutual
endearment of two persons enamoured of each other can
therefore have no place in the heart of a Chinese: and it is to
the effusions of a heart thus circumstanced, that poetry owes
some of its greatest charms. Nor can they be considered as a
nation of warriors; and war, next to love, has ever been the
favourite theme of the muses.</p>

<p>The language is much better adapted to the concise style of
ethics, than the sublime flights of poetry. The moral precepts
of Cong-foo-tse display an excellent mind in the writer, and
would do honour to any age and nation. The following will
serve as a specimen of his subjects, style, and manner.</p>

<p>"There is one clear rule of conduct: to act with sincerity; and
to conform with all one's soul, and with all one's strength, to
this universal rule&mdash;do not any thing to another, that you
would not wish another should do to you."</p>

<p>How conformable is this sentiment as well as the words in which
it is expressed, to that of the great Author of our religion; a religion
whose "ways are ways of pleasantness, and all whose
paths are peace."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five things ought to be well observed in the world:
Justice between the prince and the subject; affection between
father and son; fidelity between man and wife;
subordination among brothers; concord among friends."</p>

<p>"There are three radical virtues: prudence to discern; universal
benevolence to embrace (all mankind); courage to
sustain."</p>

<p>"What passes in a man's mind is unknown to others: if you
are wise, take great care of what none but yourself can see."</p>

<p>"Examples are better for the people than precepts."</p>

<p>"A wise man is his own most severe censor: he is his own
accuser, his own evidence, and his own judge."</p>

<p>"A nation may accomplish more by bravery than by fire
and water. I never knew a people perish, who had courage
for their support."</p>

<p>"An upright man will not pursue a crooked path; he follows
the straight road, and walks therein secure."</p>

<p>Having taken this short view of their language and literature,
I shall now proceed to shew the present state of the arts and
sciences, as far as the communications I had not only with the
missionaries, but also with some of the most learned Chinese,
will allow me to pronounce on these points. The observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
I have to make must of course be very general; minute particulars
will not be expected in a work of this nature. There is
no branch of science which the Chinese affect to value so much,
and understand so little, as astronomy. The necessity indeed
of being able to mark, with some degree of precision, the returns
of the seasons and certain periods, in so large a community,
must have directed an early attention of the government to this
subject; and accordingly we find, that an astronomical board
has formed one of the state establishments from the earliest periods
of their history. Yet so little progress have they made in
this science, that the only part of its functions, which can be
called astronomical, has long been committed to the care of
foreigners, whom they affect to hold in contempt and to consider
as barbarians. The principal object of this board is to
frame and to publish a national calendar, and to point out to the
government the suitable times and seasons for its important undertakings.
Even when the marriage of a prince or princess of
the blood is about to take place, the commissioners of astronomy
must appoint a fortunate day for the celebration of the nuptials,
which is announced in form in the Pekin Gazette.</p>

<p>In this important almanack, as in the Greek and Roman calendars,
are inserted all the supposed lucky and unlucky days in
the year, predictions of the weather, days proper for taking medicine,
commencing journies, taking home a wife, laying the
foundation of a house, and other matters of moment, for entering
upon which particular times are assigned. To the superintendency
of the Chinese members of this august tribunal is committed
the astrological part, a committee of whom is selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
annually for the execution of this important task. Whether
the men of letters, as they call themselves, really believe in the
absurdities of judicial astrology, or whether they may think it
necessary to encourage the observance of popular superstitions,
on political considerations, I will not take upon me to decide.
If, however, they should happen to possess any such superior
knowledge, great credit is due to them for acting the farce with
such apparent earnestness, and with so much solemnity. The
duration of the same system has certainly been long enough for
them to have discovered, that the multitude are more effectually
governed by opinion than by power.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the heavenly bodies, to an enlightened
and intelligent mind, furnish the most grand and sublime spectacle
in nature; to the ignorant and superstitious, the most
awful. The common people of all countries, and in all ages,
have considered the occasional privation of the light of the two
great luminaries of heaven as the forerunners of some extraordinary
event, whilst the more intelligent part of the community
have turned these superstitious notions to their advantage.
Thales is said to have been able to calculate the returns of
eclipses six hundred years before the birth of Christ; of course,
he was well acquainted with the causes by which they were
produced; yet his countrymen were always filled with superstition
and terror on the event of an eclipse. Plutarch has observed
that Pericles learned from Anaxagoras to overcome the
terrors which the various phenomena of the heavens inspired
into those who knew not their causes; and he mentions a strik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>ing
proof which he gave of this knowledge, on his expedition
against Peloponnesus, when there happened an eclipse of the sun.
The sudden darkness, being considered as an omen unfavourable
to the object of the expedition, occasioned a general consternation.
Pericles, observing the pilot of his own galley to be
frightened and confused, took his cloak and placed it before
his eyes, asking him at the same time if he found any thing
alarming, or of evil presage, in what he then did? and upon
his answering in the negative: "Where then is the difference,"
said Pericles, "between this covering and the other, except
that something of greater extent than my cloak deprives us of
the light of the sun?" Nor can it be doubted that Alexander
when, on a like occasion, previous to the battle of Arbêla,
he commanded a sacrifice to be made to the sun, the moon,
and the earth, as being the three powers to which eclipses were
owing, did it merely to appease the superstitious notions of his
army. To suppose him ignorant of their causes, would be paying
an ill compliment to his great master. Thus it might have
been with regard to the Chinese government, which, whether
through ignorance or policy, still continues to observe with the
greatest solemnity the same ceremonies, or nearly so, on the
event of an eclipse, which were in use among the Egyptians,
Greeks, and Romans, near two thousand years ago. When
the moon was darkened by an eclipse, their drums and clarions
and trumpets were sounded, under the notion that, by their
shrill and loud noise, they might assist in relieving the labouring
goddess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"A vast eclipse darkens the neighbouring planet,<br />
Sound there, sound all our instruments of war;<br />
Clarions and trumpets, silver, brass, and iron,<br />
And beat a thousand drums to help her labour."<br />
</div></div>

<p>The brazen gong is violently beat by the Chinese on the same
occasion; and that such an event may not pass unobserved, and
the luminary thereby be deprived of the usual assistance of music,
to frighten away or to charm the dragon, which they suppose
to have seized upon it, the great officers of state in every
city and principal town are instructed to give public notice of
the time it will happen, according to the calculations of the national
almanack. A rude projection of a lunar eclipse, that
happened whilst we were at <i>Tong-choo</i>, was stuck up in the corners
of the streets; all the officers were in mourning, and all
business was suspended for that day. When the Dutch Embassadors
were in Pekin, the sun was eclipsed on the 21st of January
1795, which happened to be the first day of their new
year: a day observed through the whole empire with the greatest
festivity and rejoicing; and almost the only day on which
the bulk of the people refrain from their respective occupations.
The Embassador and his suite were summoned to court
at the usual hour of three in the morning. On arriving at the
palace they were told that, in consequence of an eclipse of the
sun, which was about to happen on that day and which was
a most unfortunate event, portending an unhappy year to their
country, the Emperor would not be visible for three days, during
which time the whole court would go into mourning; that
the amusements, feasts, and entertainments usual on this parti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>cular
day would be suspended from one end of the empire to
the other.</p>

<p>Before an eclipse happens, the members of the mathematical
board and other learned men in office assemble near the
palace, each having in his hand a sketch of the obscuration, in
order to witness the truth of the astronomer's calculation. But
if these people were not all interested in making the calculation
to agree with the time and other circumstances of the eclipse, the
astronomers would run no great hazard of being detected in an
error, provided it was not a very glaring one, as they have no
instruments for measuring time with any tolerable degree of accuracy.
The moment the eclipse begins, they all fall down on their
knees, and bow their heads nine times to the ground, during
which is struck up a horrible crash of gongs, kettle-drums,
trumpets, and other noisy instruments, intended to scare the
devouring dragon.</p>

<p>From the observance of such extravagant ceremonies it would
not be fair to infer their total ignorance of the principles of
astronomy; but that such is really the case, the latter part of
their history furnishes abundant testimony. In the thirteenth
century, when Gengis-Khan the Mongul Tartar first entered
China, and his successor Kublai-Khan effected the conquest of
the country, the greatest disorder and confusion prevailed in
their chronology. They were neither able to regulate the reckoning
of time, nor to settle the limits of the different provinces,
nor even to ascertain the divisions of lands as allotted to the several
districts. Kublai, according to their own annals, held out en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>couragement
for learned men to frequent his court from every
part of the world, and through the means of the missionaries,
both of the Christian and Mahomedan faith, but principally the
latter, and perhaps still more through the descendants of the
Greeks, who anciently settled in Bactriana, many important
improvements were then introduced into China. He caused a
regular survey to be taken of the whole empire. He adjusted
their chronology, and corrected the errors of their astronomical
observations; he imported various mathematical and astronomical
instruments from Balk and Samarcand; such as were then in
use among the Chinese being of a rude construction, and unfit
to make observations of the heavenly bodies with any tolerable
degree of accuracy; and he repaired the grand communication
by water that connects the northern with the southern extremities
of the empire, a work, in the contemplation of which
the mind is not more strongly impressed with the grandeur and
magnitude of the object, than with the pleasing sense of its important
utility.</p>

<p>In some of the early accounts of China, published in Europe,
we find the description of certain instruments, said to have
been discovered on a mountain near the city of Nankin, and
afterwards placed by the Chinese partly in that capital and
partly in Pekin. On a more accurate examination of those instruments
it appeared, that they had all been constructed for
some particular place lying under the 37th parallel of latitude;
from whence it followed, that all the observations made with
them at Pekin, which is in 39° 55'. north, as well as all those
made at Nankin in 32° 4'. north, must have been entirely false:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and the very act of placing them so distant from the parallel
for which they were constructed, is in itself a sufficient proof
of the ignorance of the Chinese in matters of this kind.
Mr. Pauw has given the most probable conjecture respecting
those instruments. He supposes them to have been made at
Balk, in Bactriana, by some of those Greeks who obtained the
government of that province under the successors of Alexander,
and that they had passed into China during the period of the
Mongul government.</p>

<p>The death of Kublai-Khan was speedily followed by the
total expulsion of the Tartars from China; and most probably,
at the same time, of all those learned men they had been the
means of introducing into the country; for when the empire
was again subdued by the Mantchoo Tartars, whose race now
fills the throne, <i>Sun-chee</i>, the first Emperor of the present
dynasty, observes in an edict published by him in 1650, that
since the expulsion of the Monguls, the Chinese had not been
able to make a correct almanack; and that error had been accumulating
on error in their astronomical observations and chronology.
At this time, some Mahomedans were again found to
superintend the construction of the calendar; but the office devolving,
at length, upon a Chinese, the unfortunate almanack-maker
happened to insert a false intercalation, assigning thirteen
months to the year 1670, when it should have contained no
more than twelve. This mistake was an event too fortunate to
be overlooked by some Catholic missionaries who, at that time,
happened to be in the capital. They saw the advantages to be
derived from convincing the Tartars of the ignorance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Chinese in a matter of the last importance to the government,
and they had little doubt of success, where prejudice was already
operating in their favour. In short, the Europeans succeeded;
the almanacks of that year were declared defective,
were called in, a new edition printed off, and the poor almanack-maker
is said to have been strangled.</p>

<p>Four German Jesuits were then appointed to fill the vacant
places in the tribunal of mathematics; and, being men of learning,
they proved of no small use at court. After these the Portuguese
succeeded to the appointments of regulating the calendar,
three of whom, as already observed, are now entrusted with
this important office. Fortunately for these gentlemen, the
Chinese have no means of detecting any little inaccuracies that
may happen in their calculations. I saw, and conversed with,
numbers of their learned men at the palace of <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>,
but I can safely say, that not a single Chinese, nor a Tartar,
who shewed themselves there, were possessed of the slightest
knowledge of astronomy, nor one who could explain any of the
various phenomena of the heavenly bodies. Astronomy with
them consists entirely in a certain jargon of judicial astrology;
and they remain firmly attached to the belief of the doctrines of
their great philosopher, delivered more than two thousand years
ago, which teach them that "the heaven is round, the earth a
square fixed in the middle; the other four elements placed
at its four sides: water to the north; fire to the south; wood
to the east; and metal to the west:" and they believe the
stars to be stuck, like so many nails, at equal distances from the
earth, in the blue vault of heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the numerous eclipses taken notice of in the records
of the country, they are mere registers, noted down
whenever they happened, and not predictions or the result
of calculations. It does not appear, indeed, that the Chinese
were, at any time, able to predict an eclipse, notwithstanding
all that has been said in their favour on this subject.
The reputed Chinese tables, published by Father Couplet, have
been detected to be those of Tycho Brahe; and Cassini found
the chronology of their eclipses, published by Martinus, to be
erroneous, and their returns impossible. It could not indeed
be otherwise; the defectiveness of the calendar must necessarily
falsify all their records as to time.</p>

<p>Had the missionaries been disposed to confer a real service on
the Chinese, instead of misleading the world by their strange and
wonderful accounts of this people; instead of bestowing so
much time in translating into Chinese a set of logarithm tables
for the use of <i>Kaung-shee</i>, the second Emperor of the present
dynasty, of which they pretend he was so fond that he always
carried them about with him suspended to his girdle, they
should rather have taught them the use, and the convenience,
of the Arabic numbers, of whose combinations and results their
own language is not capable, and have instructed a few of their
youth in the principles of arithmetic and the mathematics. For
such an omission, however, human nature can readily find an
excuse. It would be too great an instance of self-denial, to relinquish
the advantages and the credit which their superior skill
had gained them over a vast empire, by making the individuals
of that empire participate in their knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>When we reflect, for a moment, how many perplexities and
difficulties were occasioned by the irregular coincidences of
the solar and lunar periods, in the calendars of Europe, from the
time of Julius Cæsar to the altering of the style by Pope Gregory,
we may readily conceive how great must be the errors in
the chronology of a country, where the inhabitants are entirely
ignorant even of the first principles of astronomy, and where
they depended on the adventitious aid of foreigners, to enable
them to carry into execution one of the most important concerns
of the government.</p>

<p>Every thing of their own invention and discovery carries
with it such strong marks of originality, as cannot easily be
mistaken. The language declares itself to be most unquestionably
the production of the country; so does the mariner's compass;
and they have a cycle, or period, to assist their chronology,
of which I think none will dispute with them the invention.
In their records it is carried back to the time of the Emperor
<i>Whang-tee</i>, the third from <i>Fo-shee</i>. This cycle, consisting
of sixty years, has no reference to the periods of the motions
or coincidences of the sun and moon, as one of the same
period among the Hindus, but is used merely as our century,
to distinguish time into eras or ages. Instead of denominating
any given year the first, second, or third year of such a cycle,
they have assumed two sets of characters, one set consisting of
ten, and the other of twelve; the first are called the ten roots,
and the second the twelve branches. The combination of a
root and a branch gives a name for the year; and the different
permutations, of which they are capable, supply them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
sixty distinct titles, making the complete cycle of sixty years.
The nature of this period may be rendered familiar to such as are
not conversant with the combination of numbers, by assuming
the numerals from 1 to 10 for the ten roots, and the letters of
the alphabet from <i>a</i> to <i>m</i>, for the twelve branches, and by
placing them in a circle, in the following manner, where the
cycle begins with the letter <i>a</i>.</p>

<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="images/i294.jpg" width="430" height="422" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Supposing these letters and figures to be Chinese characters, the
first year of any cycle would be called 1<i>a</i>, the second 2<i>b</i>, the
third 3<i>c</i>, and so on to 10<i>k</i>, the tenth year; the eleventh would
be 1<i>l</i>, the twelfth 2<i>m</i>, the thirteenth 3<i>a</i>, and the sixtieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
10<i>m</i>, when the whole revolution would be completed. This
cycle, though always used in the records of their history, never
appears in the date of public acts. These only specify the time
of the reign under which they are given, as the 1st. 2d. or 3d.
day of the 1st. 2d. or 3d. moon, of the 1st. 2d. or 3d. year of the
reign of such or such an Emperor.</p>

<p>Little progress as they appear to have made in the science of
astronomy, their knowledge of geography, which supposes indeed
an acquaintance with the former, is equally limited. Their
own empire was considered to occupy the middle space of the
square surface of the earth, the rest of which was made up of
islands. When the Jesuits first entered China, they found the
charts, even of their own country, rude and incorrect sketches,
without any scale or proportion, wherein a ridge of mountains
covered a whole province, and a river swept away half of another.
At present they have neat and accurate maps of the
country, copied after the original survey of the whole empire,
undertaken and completed by the Jesuits, after several years of
indefatigable labour.</p>

<p>Although the Chinese language be unfavourable for <a name="numerical" id="numerical"></a>numerical
combinations it is admirably adapted for the concise
operations of algebra, and the terse demonstrations of geometry,
to neither of which, however, has it ever been made subservient,
both the one and the other being totally unknown in
the country. Their arithmetic is mechanical. To find the
aggregate of numbers, a machine is in universal use, from the
man of letters, to the meanest shopman behind his counter.
By this machine, which is called a <i>Swan-pan</i>, arithmetical
operations are rendered palpable. It consists of a frame of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
wood, divided into two compartments by a bar running down
the middle: through this bar, at right angles, are inserted a
number of parallel wires, and on each wire, in one compartment,
are five moveable balls, and in the other two. These
wires may be considered as the ascending and descending powers
of a numeration table, proceeding in a tenfold proportion; so
that if a ball upon any of the wires, in the larger compartment,
be placed against the middle bar, and called unity or one, a ball
on the wire next above it will represent ten, and one on the
next one hundred; so, also, a ball on the wire next below that
expressing unity will be one-tenth, the next lower one hundredth,
and the third one thousandth, part of an unit; and the
balls on the corresponding wires in the smaller compartment
will be five, fifty, five hundred, five-tenths, five hundredths,
five thousandths; the value or power of each of these, in the
smaller division, being always five times as much as of those in
the larger. In the following figure, suppose X be assumed as the
line of units, the lines to the right will be integers decimally increasing,
and those to the left fractional parts decimally decreasing;
and the <i>Swan-pan</i> in the present position of the balls, will
represent the number 573916 0705/10000.</p>

<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="images/i296.jpg" width="393" height="258" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;">This is clearly a system of decimal arithmetic, which, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ease, simplicity, and convenience of its operations, it were to
be wished was generally adopted in Europe, instead of the
endless ways in which the integer is differently divided in different
countries, and in the different provinces of the same
country. The <i>Swan-pan</i> would be no bad instrument for
teaching to a blind person the operations of arithmetic. Yet,
paradoxical as it may seem, these operations, as performed by
the Chinese, like their written characters, require more the exercise
of the eye than of the mind. The simple addition or subtraction
of the little balls to, or from, the middle bar, shews at
once by their disposition on the board the result of any required
combination. The invention of it I think may fairly be attributed
to the Chinese; though it has been compared, how justly
I cannot pretend to say, to the Roman <i>abacus</i>.</p>

<p>It has been observed, and perhaps with a great deal of truth,
that the arts which supply the luxuries, the conveniences, and
the necessaries of life, have derived but little advantage in the
first instance from the labours and speculations of philosophers;
that the ingenuity of artists, the accidental or progressive discoveries
of common workmen, in any particular branch of business,
have frequently afforded <i>data</i>, from which, by the reasonings
and investigations of philosophers, hints have sometimes
been struck out for arriving at the same ends by a shorter
way; that the learned are therefore more properly to be considered
as improvers than inventors. Of this mortifying truth,
the Chinese afford many strong examples in their arts and manufactures,
and particularly in some of those operations that
have a reference to chemistry, which cannot here be said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
exist as a science, although several branches are in common
practice as chemical arts. Without possessing any theory concerning
the affinities of bodies, or attractions of cohesion or
aggregation, they clarify the muddy waters of their rivers, for
immediate use, by stirring them round with a piece of alum in
a hollow bamboo; a simple operation which, experience has
taught them, will cause the clayey particles to fall to the bottom:
and having ascertained the fact, they have given themselves
no further trouble to explain the phenomenon.</p>

<p>In like manner, they are well acquainted with the effect of
steam upon certain bodies that are immersed in it; that its heat
is much greater than that of boiling water. Yet, although for
ages they have been in the constant practice of confining it in
close vessels, something like <i>Papin's digester</i>, for the purpose of
softening horn, from which their thin, transparent, and capacious
lanterns are made, they seem not to have discovered its
extraordinary force when thus pent up; at least, they have
never thought of applying that power to purposes which animal
strength has not been adequate to effect. They extract from
the three kingdoms of nature the most brilliant colours, which
they have also acquired the art of preparing and mixing, so
as to produce every intermediate tint; and, in their richest and
most lively hues, they communicate these colours to silks, cottons,
and paper; yet they have no theory on colours.</p>

<p>The process of smelting iron from the ore is well known to
them; and their cast ware of this metal is remarkably thin and
light. They have also an imperfect knowledge of converting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
it into steel, but their manufactures of this article are not to be
mentioned with those of Europe, I will not say of England,
because it stands unrivalled in this and indeed almost every
other branch of the arts. Though their cast-iron wares appear
light and neat, and are annealed in heated ovens, to take off
somewhat of their brittleness, yet their process of rendering
cast iron malleable is imperfect, and all their manufactures of
wrought iron are consequently of a very inferior kind, not
only in workmanship but also in the quality of the metal.
In most of the other metals their manufactures are above mediocrity.
Their trinkets of silver fillagree are extremely neat,
and their articles of tootanague are highly finished.</p>

<p>With the use of cannon they pretend to have been long
acquainted. When Gengis-Khan entered China, in the thirteenth
century, artillery and bombs and mines are said to have
been employed on both sides; yet when the city of Macao, in
the year 1621, made a present to the Emperor of three pieces
of artillery, it was found necessary to send along with them
three men to instruct the Chinese how to use them. The introduction
of matchlocks, I am inclined to think, is of no
very ancient date; they wear no marks of originality about
them, like other articles of Chinese invention; on the contrary,
they are exact models of the old Portugueze matchlock;
and differ in nothing from those which still continue to be
carried, as an article of commerce, by this nation to Cochin-China.
There can be no doubt, however, of the use of gunpowder
being known to the Chinese long before the Christian
era.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: .5em;">In a very ancient treatise on the military art, there is a
detailed account of the manner how to annoy an enemy's
camp, by springing a mine with gunpowder; but this treatise
makes no mention of cannon. Fire-works, made generally of
gunpowder, filings of zinc, camphor, and other ingredients,
are described in various old tracts. It is easily conceived, that
the deflagration of nitre was likely to be first noticed in those
countries where it is the spontaneous and abundant production
of the earth, which is the case on the elevated desarts of Tartary
and Thibet, and on the low and extensive plains of India
and China. The gunpowder, however, made by the Chinese
is extremely bad. They have no particular manufactory, but
each individual makes his own. It is in fact one part of the
soldier's employment to prepare his own gunpowder. The
usual proportions, according to <i>Van-ta-gin</i>'s information are,</p>


<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
50 pounds of nitre,<br />
25 &mdash;&mdash; sulphur,<br />
25 &mdash;&mdash; charcoal.</div></div>


<p>They know not the art of granulating the paste, as in Europe,
but use it in a coarse powder, which sometimes cakes together
into a solid mass; and from the impurity of the nitre, (no
means appearing to be employed for extracting the common
salt it usually contains) the least exposure to the air, by attracting
the moisture, makes it unfit for service. This may be one reason
for their objection to firelocks.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that the three great discoveries of the
magnetic needle, of gunpowder, and of printing, in Europe,
followed close upon the return of the famous traveller Marco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Polo. It was the boast indeed of <i>Caung-shee</i> to the Jesuits,
when they instructed him in some of the sciences of Europe,
that the latter country was neither acquainted with the mariner's
compass, nor with the art of printing, nor with gunpowder,
till they had been in common use in China near
two thousand years. As to gunpowder, it is pretty obvious,
that our countryman Roger Bacon was well acquainted with
the ingredients that enter into its composition. In more than
one part of his works he observes, that with saltpetre and
other articles may be made a fire that will inflame to a great
distance; and in one place he states, that with sulphur, saltpetre,
and something else, which he disguises under two or three
barbarous words, a composition may be made, by which the
effects of thunder and of lightning may be imitated. Bacon
died in the year 1292, and Marco Polo returned to Europe in
1295; so that he could not possibly have received any hint
to lead towards the discovery through the channel of the
Venetian traveller<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>If the Chinese had, at any period of their history, been
acquainted with the art of casting large cannon, and of making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>use of them in their wars, it is scarcely probable they would
ever have lost it. Yet it is very certain the two Jesuits, Schaal
and Verbiest, took great pains to instruct them in the method
of casting cannon; in which, however, they have not made
any progress or improvement. I observed, near one of the
gates of Pekin, a few rude, ill-shapen, and disproportionate
pieces, lying unmounted on the ground, and these, with
some of the same kind on the frontiers of Canton, and a few
pieces, apparently twelve pounders, at <i>Hang-tcheu-foo</i>, which
had wooden pent-houses erected over each, were the only
cannon that we noticed in the whole country. Whether the
specimens, exhibited in the annexed plate, which were drawn
by the late Captain Parish of the Royal Artillery, be originally
of Chinese invention, or borrowed from some other nation, I
cannot take upon me to decide; but such are the pieces which
are sometimes found, scattered about the gates of some of their
cities.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell, who visited China in the suite of the Russian Embassador,
near a century ago, remarks, that "towards the
western extremity of the Great Wall, he observed some
hundreds of old cannon piled up in one of the towers, each
composed of three or four pieces of hammered iron, joined
and fastened together with hoops of the same metal." It is
probable indeed that the Chinese, like the Hindoos, before the
time of Schaal and Verbiest, made use of cannon of wrought
iron, which were hooped together like those mentioned by
Mr. Bell.</p>

<p class="sbs">In making their salutes, of which they are not sparing, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
invariably employ three small petards, or pistol-barrels rather,
which are stuck erect in the ground; and in firing these small
pieces the soldiers are so afraid, that they are discharged by
a train laid from one to the other. When Captain Parish
caused a few rounds to be fired from two field-pieces, which
were among the presents for the Emperor, in as quick succession
as possible, the Chinese officers very coolly observed,
that their own soldiers could do it just as well, and perhaps
better. And when Lord Macartney asked the Ex-viceroy of
Canton if he would wish to see his guard go through the different
evolutions as practised in Europe, he replied with equal indifference,
"That they could not possibly be new to him, who
had been so much engaged in the wars on the frontiers of
Tartary;" though the chances are, that he had never before
seen a firelock: with such ridiculous affectation of superiority,
and contempt for other nations, does the unconquerable pride
of this people inspire them. It seems, indeed, to be laid down
as a general principle, never to be caught in the admiration of
any thing brought among them by foreigners. Whenever a
man of rank came to look at the presents, if observed by any
of us, he would carelessly glance his eye over them, and affect
as much indifference as if he was in the daily habit of viewing
things of the same kind.</p>

<p>A French physician, who travelled in China, says he never
saw an alembic or distillatory apparatus in the whole country.
The art of distillation, however, is very well known, and in
common practice. Their <i>Sau-tchoo</i>, (literally burnt wine), is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
an ardent spirit distilled from various kinds of grain, but most
commonly from rice, of a strong empyreumatic flavour, not
unlike the spirit known in Scotland by the name of whiskey.
The rice is kept in hot water till the grains are swollen; it is
then mixed up with water in which has been dissolved a preparation
called <i>pe-ka</i>, consisting of rice-flour, liquorice-root,
anniseed, and garlic; this not only hastens fermentation, but is
supposed to give it a peculiar flavour. The mixture then
undergoes distillation. The <i>Sau-tchoo</i>, thus prepared, may be
considered as the basis of the best arrack, which in Java is
exclusively the manufacture of Chinese, and is nothing more
than a rectification of the above spirit, with the addition of
molasses and juice of the cocoa-nut tree. Before distillation
the liquor is simply called <i>tchoo</i>, or wine, and in this state is a
very insipid and disagreeable beverage. The vine grows extremely
well in all the provinces, even as far north as Pekin,
but the culture of it seems to meet with little encouragement,
and no wine is made from the juice of the grape, except by
the missionaries near the capital.</p>

<p>The manufacture of earthen ware, as far as depends upon
the preparation of the materials, they have carried to a pitch
of perfection not hitherto equalled by any nation, except the
Japanese, who are allowed to excel them, not only in this
branch, but also in all articles of lacquered and varnished ware,
which fetch exorbitant prices even in China. The beauty of
their porcelain, in a great degree, depends upon the extreme
labour and attention that is paid to the assortment, and the
preparation of the different articles employed. These are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
general a fine sort of clay called <i>Kao-lin</i> which is a species
of Soap-rock, and a granite called <i>Pe-tun-tse</i>, composed chiefly
of quartz, the proportion of mica being very small. These
materials are ground down and washed with the greatest care;
and when the paste has been turned or moulded into forms,
each piece is put into a box of clay before it goes into the
oven; yet with every precaution, it frequently happens (so
much is this art still a work of chance) that a whole oven
runs together and becomes a mass of vitrified matter. Neither
the Chinese nor the Japanese can boast of giving to the materials
much elegance of form. With those inimitable models
from the Greek and Roman vases, brought into modern use by
the ingenious Mr. Wedgwood, they will not bear a comparison.
And nothing can be more rude and ill-designed than
the grotesque figures and other objects painted, or rather
daubed, on their porcelain, which however are generally the
work of the wives and children of the labouring poor. That
they can do better we have evident proof; for if a pattern
be sent out from England, the artists in Canton will execute it
with scrupulous exactness; and their colours are inimitable.</p>

<p>The manufacture of glass was totally unknown among them
until the last century when, at the recommendation of the Jesuits,
a family was engaged to go from France to Pekin, for the
purpose of introducing the art of glass-making into the country.
The attempt failed of success, and the concern, at the death of
the manager, was broken up. In Canton they melt old broken
glass and mold it into new forms; and they have been taught
to coat plates of glass with silver, which are partially used as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
looking-glasses; but their common mirrors are of polished metal,
which is apparently a composition of copper and zinc.</p>

<p>The pride, or the policy, of the government affecting to despise
any thing new or foreign, and the general want of encouragement
to new inventions, however ingenious, have been
greatly detrimental to the progress of the arts and manufactures.
The people discover no want of genius to conceive, nor of dexterity
to execute; and their imitative powers have always been
acknowledged to be very great. Of the truth of this remark
we had several instances at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>. The complicated
glass lustres, consisting of several hundred pieces, were taken
down, piece by piece, in the course of half an hour, by two
Chinese, who had never seen any thing of the kind before, and
were put up again by them with equal facility; yet Mr. Parker
thought it necessary for our mechanics to attend at his warehouse
several times to see them taken down and again put together,
in order to be able to manage the business on their arrival
in China. A Chinese undertook to cut a slip of glass from
a large curved piece, intended to cover the great dome of the
planetarium, after our two artificers had broken three similar
pieces in attempting to cut them with the help of the diamond.
The man performed it in private, nor could he be prevailed on to
say in what manner he accomplished it. Being a little jagged
along the margin, I suspect it was not cut but fractured, perhaps
by passing a heated iron over a line drawn with water, or
some other fluid. It is well known that a Chinese in Canton,
on being shewn an European watch, undertook, and succeeded,
to make one like it, though he had never seen any thing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
kind before, but it was necessary to furnish him with a main
spring, which he could not make: and they now fabricate in
Canton, as well as in London, and at one third of the expence,
all those ingenious pieces of mechanism which at one time were
sent to China in such vast quantities from the repositories of
Coxe and Merlin. The mind of a Chinese is quick and apprehensive,
and his small delicate hands are formed for the execution
of neat work.</p>

<p>The manufacture of silks has been established in China at a
period so remote, as not to be ascertained from history; but the
time when the cotton plant was first brought from the northern
parts of India into the southern provinces of China is known,
and noticed in their annals. That species of the cotton plant,
from which is produced the manufacture usually called nankin
cotton, is said to loose its peculiar yellow tint in the course
of two or three years when cultivated in the southern provinces,
owing, in all probability, to the great heat of the weather and
continued sunshine. I have raised this particular species at the
Cape of Good Hope where, upon the same plant, as well as
on others produced from its seed, the pods were as full and
the tint of as deep a yellow in the third year as in the first. As
is generally the case in most of their manufactures, those of silk
and cotton do not appear to have lately undergone progressive
improvement. The want of proper encouragement from the
government, and the rigid adherence to ancient usage, have
rendered indeed all their fabrics stationary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the mechanical arts that in which they seem to have
attained the highest degree of perfection is the cutting of ivory.
In this branch they stand unrivalled, even at Birmingham, that
great nursery of the arts and manufactures where, I understand,
it has been attempted by means of a machine to cut ivory
fans and other articles, in imitation of those of the Chinese; but
the experiment, although ingenious, has not hitherto succeeded
to that degree, so as to produce articles fit to vie with those of
the latter. Nothing can be more exquisitely beautiful than
the fine open work displayed in a Chinese fan, the sticks of
which would seem to be singly cut by the hand, for whatever
pattern may be required, or a shield with coat of arms, or a
cypher, the article will be finished according to the drawing at
the shortest notice. The two outside sticks are full of bold
sharp work, undercut in such a manner as could not be performed
any other way than by the hand. Yet the most finished
and beautiful of these fans may be purchased at Canton for
five to ten Spanish dollars<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Out of a solid ball of ivory, with
a hole in it not larger than half an inch in diameter, they will
cut from nine to fifteen distinct hollow globes, one within another,
all loose and capable of being turned round in every direction,
and each of them carved full of the same kind of open
work that appears on the fans. A very small sum of money
is the price of one of these difficult trifles. Models of temples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>pagodas, and other pieces of architecture, are beautifully worked
in ivory; and from the shavings, interwoven with pieces
of quills, they make neat baskets and hats, which are as light
and pliant as those of straw. In short, all kinds of toys for
children, and other trinkets and trifles, are executed in a neater
manner and for less money in China, than in any other part
of the world.</p>

<p>The various uses, to which that elegant species of reed called
the bamboo is applied, would require a volume to enumerate.
Their chairs, their tables, their skreens, their bedsteads and
bedding, and many other household moveables, are entirely
constructed of this hollow reed, and some of them in a manner
sufficiently ingenious and beautiful. It is used on board ships
for poles, for sails, for cables, for rigging, and for caulking.
In husbandry for carts, for wheelbarrows, for wheels to raise
water, for fences, for sacking to hold grain, and a variety of
other utensils. The young shoots furnish an article of food;
and the wicks of their candles are made of its fibres. It serves
to embellish the garden of the prince, and to cover the cottage
of the peasant. It is the instrument, in the hand of power, that
keeps the whole empire in awe. In short, there are few uses to
which a Chinese cannot apply the bamboo, either entire or
split into thin laths, or further divided into fibres to be twisted
into cordage, or macerated into a pulp to be manufactured into
paper.</p>

<p>That "there is nothing new under the sun," was the observation
of a wise man in days of yore. Impressed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
same idea an ingenious and learned modern author<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> has written
a book to prove, that all the late discoveries and inventions
of Europe were known to the ancients. The discovery of making
paper from straw, although new, perhaps, in Europe, is of
very ancient date in China. The straw of rice and other grain,
the bark of the mulberry-tree, the cotton shrub, hemp, nettles,
and various other plants and materials, are employed in the
paper manufactories of China, where sheets are prepared of
such dimensions, that a single one may be had to cover the
whole side of a moderate sized room. The finer sort of paper
for writing upon has a surface as smooth as vellum, and is
washed with a strong solution of alum to prevent the ink from
sinking. Many old persons and children earn a livelihood by
washing the ink from written paper, which, being afterwards
beaten and boiled to a paste, is re-manufactured into new sheets;
and the ink is also separated from the water, and preserved for
future life. To this article of their manufacture the arts in
our own country owe so many advantages, that little requires
to be said in its favour. The Chinese, however, acknowledge
their obligations to the Coreans for the improvements in making
ink, which, not many centuries ago, were received from
them.</p>

<p>As to the art of printing, there can be little doubt of its antiquity
in China, yet they have never proceeded beyond a
wooden block. The nature, indeed, of the character is such,
that moveable types would scarcely be practicable. It is true,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>the component parts of the characters are sufficiently simple
and few in number; but the difficulty of putting them together
upon the frame, into the multitude of forms of which they are
capable, is perhaps not to be surmounted.</p>

<p>Like the rest of their inventions the chain-pump which, in
Europe, has been brought to such perfection as to constitute
an essential part of ships of war and other large vessels, continues
among the Chinese nearly in its primitive state, the principal
improvement since its first invention consisting in the substitution
of boards or basket-work for wisps of straw. Its power
with them has never been extended beyond that of raising a
small stream of water up an inclined plane, from one reservoir
to another, to serve the purposes of irrigation. They are of different
sizes, some worked by oxen, some by treading in a wheel,
and others by the hand.</p>

<p>The great advantages attainable from the use of mechanical
powers are either not understood or, purposely, not employed.
In a country of such vast population, machinery may perhaps
be considered as detrimental especially as, at least, nine-tenths
of the community must derive their subsistence from manual labour.
It may be a question, not at all decided in their minds,
whether the general advantages of facilitating labour, and gaining
time by means of machinery, be sufficient to counterbalance
the individual distress that would, for a time, be occasioned
by the introduction of such machinery. Whatever the
reason may be, no such means are to be met with in the country.
Among the presents that were carried out for the Empe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>ror
were an apparatus for the air pump, various articles for
conducting a set of experiments in electricity, and the models
of a complete set of mechanical powers placed upon a brass pillar.
The Emperor, happening to cast his eye upon them, enquired
of the eunuch in waiting for what they were intended.
This mutilated animal, although he had been daily studying the
nature and use of the several presents, in order to be able to say
something upon them when they should be exhibited to his
master, could not succeed in making his Imperial Majesty
comprehend the intention of the articles in question. "I
fancy," says the old monarch, "they are meant as playthings
for some of my great grandchildren."</p>

<p>The power of the pulley is understood by them, and is applied
on board all their large vessels, but always in a single
state; at least, I never observed a block with more than one
wheel in it. The principle of the lever should also seem to be
well known, as all their valuable wares, even silver and gold,
are weighed with the steelyard: and the tooth and pinion
wheels are used in the construction of their self-moving toys,
and in all their rice-mills that are put in motion by a water
wheel. But none of the mechanical powers are applied on the
great scale to facilitate and to expedite labour. Simplicity is the
leading feature in all their contrivances that relate to the arts
and manufactures. The tools of every artificer are of a construction
the most simple that it should seem possible to make
them, and yet each tool is so contrived as to answer several purposes.
Thus, the bellows of the blacksmith, which is nothing
more than a hollow cylinder of wood, with a valvular piston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
beside blowing the fire, serves for his seat when set on end,
and as a box to contain the rest of his tools. The barber's
bamboo basket, that contains his apparatus, is also the seat for
his customers. The joiner makes use of his rule as a walking
stick, and the chest that holds his tools serves him as a bench
to work on. The pedlar's box and a large umbrella are sufficient
for him to exhibit all his wares, and to form his little
shop.</p>

<p>Little can be said in favour of the state of the fine arts in this
country. Of their poetry, modern and ancient, I have given
a specimen; but I think it right once more to observe that,
with regard to Asiatic compositions, Europeans cannot form a
proper judgment, and more especially of those of the Chinese,
which, to the mysterious and obscure expressions of metaphor,
add the disadvantage of a language that speaks but little to the
ear; a whole sentence, or a combination of ideas, being sometimes
shut up in a short monosyllable, whose beauties are most
studiously addressed to the sense of seeing alone.</p>

<p>Of the other two sister arts, painting and music, a more decided
opinion may be passed. Of the latter I have little to observe.
It does not seem to be cultivated as a science: it is neither
learned as an elegant accomplishment, nor practiced as an amusement
of genteel life, except by those females who are educated
for sale, or by such as hire themselves out for the entertainment
of those who may be inclined to purchase their favours. And
as the Chinese differ in their ideas from all other nations, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
women play generally upon wind instruments, such as small
pipes and flutes; whilst the favourite instrument of the men is
the guittar or something not very unlike it, some of which have
two strings, some four, and others seven. Eunuchs, and the
lowest class of persons, are hired to play; and the merit of a
performance should seem to consist in the intenseness of the noise
brought out of the different instruments. The gong or, as they
call it, the <i>loo</i> is admirably adapted for this purpose. This instrument
is a sort of shallow kettle, or rather the lid of a kettle, which
they strike with a wooden mallet covered with leather. The
composition is said to be copper, tin, and bismuth. They have also
a kind of clarinet, three or four different sorts of trumpets, and a
stringed instrument not unlike a violoncello. Their <i>sing</i> is a
combination of uneven reeds of bamboo, not unlike the pipe
of Pan; the tones are far from being disagreeable, but its construction
is so wild and irregular, that it does not appear to be
reducible to any kind of scale. Their kettle drums are generally
shaped like barrels; and these, as well as different-sized
bells fixed in a frame, constitute parts in their sacred music.
They have also an instrument of music which consists
of stones, cut into the shape of a carpenter's square, each stone
suspended by the corner in a wooden frame. Those which I
saw appeared to belong to that species of the silicious genus
usually called Gneiss, a sort of slaty granite. In the Keswick
museum are musical stones of the same kind, which were picked
up in a rivulet at the foot of Skiddaw mountain; but these seem
to contain small pieces of black shorl or tourmaline. It is indeed
the boast of their historians, that the whole empire of na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>ture
has been laid under contribution in order to complete their
system of music: that the skins of animals, the fibres of plants,
metals, stones, and baked earths, have all been employed in
the production of sounds. Their instruments, it is true, are
sufficiently varied, both as to shape and materials, but I know
of none that is even tolerable to an European ear. An English
gentleman in Canton took some pains to collect the various instruments
of the country, of which the annexed plate is a representation,
but his catalogue is not complete.</p>

<p>A Chinese band generally plays, or endeavours to play, in
unison, and sometimes an instrument takes the octave; but
they never attempt to play in separate parts, confining their
art to the melody only, if I may venture to apply a name of so
much sweetness to an aggregation of harsh sounds. They have
not the least notion of counter-point, or playing in parts: an
invention indeed to which the elegant Greeks had not arrived,
and which was unknown in Europe as well as Asia, until the
monkish ages.</p>

<p>I never heard but one single Chinese who could be said to sing
with feeling or plaintiveness. Accompanied with a kind of guittar,
he sung the following air in praise of the flower <i>Moo-lee</i>, which
it seems is one of the most popular songs in the whole country.
The simple melody was taken down by Mr. Hittner, and I
understand has been published in London, with head and tail-pieces,
accompaniments, and all the refined arts of European
music; so that it ceases to be a specimen of the plain melody of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
China. I have therefore given it in its unadorned state, as sung
and played by the Chinese, together with the words of the first
stanza, and their literal translation.</p>

<p>They have no other notion of noting down music than that
of employing a character expressing the name of every note in
the scale; and even this imperfect way they learned from Pereira
the Jesuit. They affected to dislike the Embassador's
band which they pretended to say produced no music, but a
confusion of noises; yet the Emperor's chief musician gave himself
a great deal of trouble in tracing out the several instruments
on large sheets of paper, each of its particular size, marking the
places of the holes, screws, strings, and other parts, which they
conceived necessary to enable them to make others of a similar
construction.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to assign the motive that induced Father
Amiot to observe, that "the Chinese, in order to obtain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
scale of notes or gamut perfect, were not afraid of submitting
to the most laborious operations of geometry, and to the most
tedious and disgusting calculations in the science of numbers;"
as he must have known, that they were altogether ignorant
of geometry, and that their arithmetic extended not beyond
their <i>Swan-pan</i>. Of the same nature is the bold and unfounded
assertion of another of the Jesuits, "that the musical
system of the Chinese was borrowed from them by the
Greeks and Egyptians, anterior to the time of Hermes or
Orpheus!"</p>

<p>With regard to painting, they can be considered in no
other light than as miserable daubers, being unable to pencil
out a correct outline of many objects, to give body to
the same by the application of proper lights and shadows, and
to lay on the nice shades of colour, so as to resemble the tints
of nature. But the gaudy colouring of certain flowers, birds,
and insects, they imitate with a degree of exactness and brilliancy
to which Europeans have not yet arrived. To give
distance to objects on canvas, by diminishing them, by faint
colouring, and by perspective, they have no sort of conception.
At <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> I found two very large paintings of
landscapes which, as to the pencilling, were done with tolerable
execution, but they were finished with a minuteness of
detail, and without any of those strong lights and masses of
shade, which give force and effect to a picture; none of the
rules of perspective were observed, nor any attempt to throw
the objects to their proper distances; yet I could not help fancying
that I discovered in them the hand of an European. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
old eunuch, who carried the keys of the room, frequently
asked me, when looking at these pictures, if I did not think
his countrymen were excellent painters; and having one day
expressed great admiration for the talents of the artist, he led
me into a recess of the room, and opening a chest, supported
upon a pedestal, he observed, with a significant look, he was now
going to produce something that would astonish me. He then
took out several large volumes, which were full of figures,
drawn in a very superior style and tinted with water colours,
representing the several trades and occupations carried on in the
country; but they seemed to be stuck against the paper, having
neither shadow nor foreground, nor distance, to give them
any relief. On the opposite page to each figure was a description,
in the Mantchoo Tartar and the Chinese languages. Having
turned over one of the volumes, I observed, on the last page,
the name of <i>Castaglione</i>, which at once solved the riddle. On
re-examining the large pictures in the hall, I found the same
name in the corner of each. While going through the volume,
the old eunuch frequently asked, if any one in Europe could
paint like the Chinese? but, on my pointing to the name, and
repeating the word <i>Castaglione</i>, he immediately shut the book
and returned them all into the chest, nor, from that time, could
I ever prevail upon him to let me have another sight of them.
On enquiry, I found that Castaglione was a missionary in great
repute at court, where he executed a number of paintings, but
was expressly directed by the Emperor to paint all his subjects
after the Chinese manner, and not like those of Europe, with
broad masses of shade and the distant objects scarcely visible,
observing to him, as one of the missionaries told me, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
imperfections of the eye afforded no reason why the objects of
nature should also be copied as imperfect. This idea of the
Emperor accords with a remark made by one of his ministers,
who came to see the portrait of His Britannic Majesty, "that
it was great pity it should have been spoiled by the dirt upon
the face," pointing, at the same time, to the broad shade of
the nose.</p>

<p>Ghirrardini, an European painter, published an account of
his voyage to China, where, it appears, he was so disgusted
that, having observed how little idea they possess of the fine
arts, he adds, with rather more petulancy than truth, "these
Chinese are fit for nothing but weighing silver, and eating
rice." Ghirrardini painted a large colonnade in vanishing
perspective, which struck them so very forcibly that they concluded
he must certainly have dealings with the Devil; but, on
approaching the canvas and feeling with their hands, in order
to be fully convinced that all they saw was on a flat surface,
they persisted that nothing could be more unnatural than to represent
distances, where there actually neither was, nor could
be, any distance.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add any thing further with regard
to the state of painting in China. I shall only observe, that the
Emperor's favourite draughtsman, who may of course be supposed
as good or better than others of the same profession in
the capital, was sent to make drawings of some of the principal
presents to carry to his master, then in Tartary, as elucidations
of the descriptive catalogue. This man, after various unsuc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>cessful
attempts to design the elegant time-pieces of Vulliamy,
supported by beautiful figures of white marble, supplicated my
assistance in a matter which he represented as of the last importance
to himself. It was in vain to assure him that I was no
draughtsman; he was determined to have the proof of it; and
he departed extremely well satisfied in obtaining a very mean
performance with the pencil, to copy after or cover with his
China ink. Every part of the machines, except the naked
figures which supported the time-piece and a barometer, he
drew with neatness and accuracy, but all his attempts to copy
these were unsuccessful. Whether it was owing to any real
difficulty that exists in the nice turns and proportions of the human
figure, or that by being better acquainted with it we more
readily perceive the defects in the imitation of it, or from the
circumstance of the human form being concealed in this country
in loose folding robes, that caused the Chinese draughtsman
so completely to fail, I leave to the artists of our own country
to determine: but the fact was as I state it; all his attempts
to draw these figures were preposterous.</p>

<p>As to those specimens of beautiful flowers, birds, and insects,
sometimes brought over to Europe, they are the work of artists
at Canton where, from being in the habit of copying
prints and drawings, carried thither for the purpose of being
transferred to porcelain, or as articles of commerce, they have
acquired a better taste than in the interior parts of the country.
Great quantities of porcelain are sent from the potteries to Canton
perfectly white, that the purchaser may have them painted
to his own pattern: and specimens of these bear testimony that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
they are no mean copyists. It has been observed, however, that
the subjects of natural history, painted by them, are frequently
incorrect; that it is no unusual thing to meet with the flower of
one plant set upon the stalk of another, and having the leaves of
a third. This may formerly have been the case, from their following
imperfect patterns, or from supposing they could improve
nature; but having found that the representations of natural objects
are in more request among foreigners, they pay a
stricter attention to the subject that may be required; and we
found them indeed such scrupulous copyists, as not only to draw
the exact number of the petals, the stamina, and pistilla of a
flower, but also the very number of leaves, with the thorns or
spots on the foot-stalk that supported it. They will even count
the number of scales on a fish, and mark them out in their representations,
and it is impossible to imitate the brilliant colours of
nature more closely. I brought home several drawings of
plants, birds, and insects, that have been greatly admired for
their accuracy and close colouring; but they want that effect
which the proper application of light and shade never fails to
produce. The coloured prints of Europe that are carried out
to Canton are copied there with wonderful fidelity. But in
doing this, they exercise no judgment of their own. Every defect
and blemish, original or accidental, they are sure to copy,
being mere servile imitators, and not in the least feeling the
force or the beauty of any specimen of the arts that may come
before them; for the same person who is one day employed in
copying a beautiful European print, will sit down the next to a
Chinese drawing replete with absurdity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever may be the progress of the arts in the port of
Canton, they are not likely to experience much improvement
in the interior parts of the country, or in the capital. It was
the pride rather of the monarch, and of his ministers, that
made them reject the proposal of Castaglione to establish a
school for the arts, than the apprehension, as stated by the missionaries,
that the rage for painting would become so general, as
to be prejudicial to useful labour.</p>

<p>In a country where painting is at so low an ebb, it would be
in vain to expect much execution from the chissel. Grotesque
images of ideal beings, and monstrous distortions of nature, are
sometimes seen upon the ballustrades of bridges, and in their
temples, where the niches are filled with gigantic gods of baked
clay, sometimes painted with gaudy colours, and sometimes
plastered over with gold leaf, or covered with a coat of varnish.
They are as little able to model as to draw the human figure
with any degree of correctness. In the whole empire there is
not a statue, a hewn pillar, or a column that deserves to be
mentioned. Large four-sided blocks of stone or wood are frequently
erected near the gates of cities, with inscriptions upon
them, meant to perpetuate the memory of certain distinguished
characters; but they are neither objects of grandeur nor ornament,
having a much closer resemblance to a gallows than to
triumphal arches, as the missionaries, for what reason I know
not, have thought fit to call them.</p>

<p>The intention of these monumental erections will appear
from some of their inscriptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of their architecture, indeed, is as unsightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
as unsolid; without elegance or convenience of design, and
without any settled proportion; mean in its appearance,
and clumsy in the workmanship. Their pagodas of five,
seven, and nine rounds, or roofs, are the most striking objects;
but though they appear to be the imitations or, perhaps,
more properly speaking, the models of a similar kind
of pyramids found in India, they are neither so well designed,
nor so well executed: they are, in fact, so very ill constructed
that half of them, without any marks of antiquity, appear
in ruins; of these useless and whimsical edifices His Majesty's
garden at Kew exhibits a specimen, which is not inferior
in any respect to the very best I have met with in China. The
height of such structures, and the badness of the materials with
which they are usually built, contradict the notion that they
assign as a reason for the lowness of their houses, which is, that
they may escape being thrown down by earthquakes. In fact,
the tent stands confessed in all their dwellings, of which the
curved roof and the wooden pillars (in imitation of the poles)
forming a colonnade round the ill-built brick walls, clearly denote
the origin; and from this original form they have never
ventured to deviate. Their temples are mostly constructed
upon the same plan, with the addition of a second, and sometimes
a third roof, one above the other. The wooden pillars
that constitute the colonnade are generally of larch fir, of no
settled proportion between the length and the diameter, and
they are invariably painted red and sometimes covered with a
coat of varnish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>As custom and fashion are not the same in any two countries,
it has been contended by many that there can be no such thing
as true taste. The advocates for taste arising out of custom will
say, that no solid reason can be offered why the pillar which
supports the Doric capital should be two diameters shorter than
that which sustains the Corinthian; and that it is the habit only
of seeing them thus constructed that constitutes their propriety.
Though the respective beauties of these particular columns may,
in part, be felt from the habit of observing them always retaining
a settled proportion, yet it must be allowed that, in the most
perfect works of nature, there appears a certain harmony and
agreement of one part with another, that without any settled
proportion seldom fail to please. Few people will disagree
in their ideas of a handsome tree, or an elegant flower, though
there be no fixed proportion between the trunk and the branches,
the flower and the foot-stalk. Proportion, therefore, alone, is
not sufficient to constitute beauty. There must be no stiffness,
no sudden breaking off from a straight line to a curve; but the
changes should be easy, not visible in any particular part, but
running imperceptibly through the whole. Utility has also
been considered as one of the constituent parts of beauty. In
the Chinese column, labouring under an enormous mass of
roof, without either base or capital, there is neither symmetry
of parts, nor ease, nor particular utility. Nor have the large
ill-shapen and unnatural figures of lions, dragons, and serpents,
grinning on the tops and corners of the roofs, any higher pretensions
to good taste, to utility, or to beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"The architecture of the Chinese," says one of their encomiasts,
"though it bears no relation to that of Europe; though
it has borrowed nothing from that of the Greeks, has a certain
beauty peculiar to itself." It is indeed peculiar to itself,
and the missionaries may be assured they are the only persons who
will ever discover "real palaces in the mansions of the Emperor,"
or to whom, "their immensity, symmetry, and
magnificence, will announce the grandeur of the master who
inhabits them."</p>

<p>The house of a prince, or a great officer of state, in the capital,
is not much distinguished from that of a tradesman, except by the
greater space of ground on which it stands, and by being surrounded
by a high wall. Our lodgings in Pekin were in a
house of this description. The ground plot was four hundred
by three hundred feet, and it was laid out into ten or twelve
courts, some having two, some three, and others four, tent-shaped
houses, standing on stone terraces raised about three
feet above the court, which was paved with tiles. Galleries of
communication, forming colonnades of red wooden pillars,
were carried from each building and from one court to another,
so that every part of the house might be visited without
exposure to the sun or the rain. The number of wooden pillars
of which the colonnades were formed was about 900. Most
of the rooms were open to the rafters of the roof; but some
had a slight ceiling of bamboo laths covered with plaster; and
the ladies apartments consisted of two stories; the upper however
had no light, and was not so good as our common attics. The
floors were laid with bricks or clay. The windows had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
glass; oiled paper, or silk gauze, or pearl shell, or horn, were
used as substitutes for this article. In the corners of some of
the rooms were holes in the ground, covered over with stones
or wood, intended for fire-places, from whence the heat is
conveyed, as in the houses of ancient Rome, through flues in
the floor, or in the walls, the latter of which are generally
whitened with lime made from shells and imported from the
sea coast. One room was pointed out to us as the theatre. The
stage was in the middle, and a sort of gallery was erected in
front of it. A stone room was built in the midst of a piece of
water, in imitation of a passage yacht, and one of the courts
was roughened with rocks, with points and precipices and
excavations, as a representation of nature in miniature. On
the ledges of these were meant to be placed their favourite
flowers and stunted trees, for which they are famous.</p>

<p>There is not a water-closet, nor a decent place of retirement
in all China. Sometimes a stick is placed over a hole in a corner,
but in general they make use of large earthen jars with
narrow tops. In the great house we occupied was a walled
inclosure, with a row of small square holes of brick-work sunk
in the ground.</p>

<p>Next to the pagodas, the most conspicuous objects are the
gates of cities. These are generally square buildings, carried
several stories above the arched gateway and, like the temples, are
covered with one or more large projecting roofs. But the most
stupendous work of this country is the great wall that divides
it from northern Tartary. It is built exactly upon the same
plan as the wall of Pekin, being a mound of earth cased on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
each side with bricks or stone. The astonishing magnitude of
the fabric consists not so much in the plan of the work, as in
the immense distance of fifteen hundred miles over which it
is extended, over mountains of two and three thousand feet in
height, across deep vallies and rivers. But the elevations, plans,
and sections of this wall and its towers have been taken with
such truth and accuracy by the late Captain Parish, of the Royal
Artillery, that all further description would be superfluous.
They are to be found in Sir George Staunton's valuable account
of the embassy to China.</p>

<p>The same Emperor, who is said to have committed the barbarous
act of destroying the works of the learned, raised this
stupendous fabric, which has no parallel in the whole world,
not even in the pyramids of Egypt, the magnitude of the largest
of these containing only a very small portion of the quantity of
matter comprehended in the great wall of China. This indeed
is so enormous, that admitting, what I believe has never been
denied, its length to be fifteen hundred miles, and the dimensions
throughout pretty much the same as where it was crossed
by the British Embassy, the materials of all the dwelling-houses
of England and Scotland, supposing them to amount to one
million eight hundred thousand, and to average on the whole
two thousand cubic feet of masonry or brick-work, are barely
equivalent to the bulk or solid contents of the great wall of
China. Nor are the projecting massy towers of stone and brick
included in this calculation. These alone, supposing them to
continue throughout at bow-shot distance, were calculated to
contain as much masonry and brick-work as all London. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
give another idea of the mass of matter in this stupendous fabric,
it may be observed, that it is more than sufficient to surround
the circumference of the earth on two of its great circles,
with two walls, each six feet high and two feet thick! It is to
be understood, however, that in this calculation is included the
earthy part in the middle of the wall.</p>

<p>Turning from an object, which the great Doctor Johnson
was of opinion would be an honour to any one to say that his
grandfather had seen, another presents itself scarcely inferior in
point of grandeur, and greatly excelling it in general utility.
This is what has usually been called the imperial or grand canal,
an inland navigation of such extent and magnitude as to stand
unrivalled in the history of the world. I may safely say that,
in point of magnitude, our most extensive inland navigation of
England can no more be compared to the grand trunk that
intersects China, than a park or garden fish-pond to the great
lake of Winandermere. The Chinese ascribe an antiquity to
this work higher by many centuries than to that of the great
wall; but the Tartars pretend it was first opened in the thirteenth
century under the Mongul government. The probability
is, that an effeminate and shameful administration had suffered
it to fall into decay, and that the more active Tartars
caused it to undergo a thorough repair: at present it exhibits no
appearances of great antiquity. The bridges, the stone piers of
the flood-gates, the quays, and the retaining walls of the earthen
embankments are comparatively new. Whether it has originally
been constructed by Chinese or Tartars, the conception
of such an undertaking, and the manner in which it is executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
imply a degree of science and ingenuity beyond what I suspect
we should now find in the country, either in one or the other
of these people. The general surface of the country and other
favourable circumstances have contributed very materially to
assist the projector, but a great deal of skill and management, as
well as of immense labour, are conspicuous throughout the
whole work.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour to convey, in a few words, a general idea of
the principles on which this grand undertaking has been carried
on. All the rivers of note in China fall from the high lands of
Tartary, which lie to the northward of Thibet, crossing the
plains of this empire in their descent to the sea from west to
east. The inland navigation being carried from north to south
cuts these rivers at right angles, the smaller streams of which
terminating in it afford a constant supply of water; and the
three great rivers, the <i>Eu-ho</i> to the north, the <i>Yellow River</i> towards
the middle, and the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i> to the south, intersecting
the canal, carry off the superfluous water to the sea.
The former, therefore, are the <i>feeders</i>, and the latter the <i>dischargers</i>,
of the great trunk of the canal. A number of difficulties
must have arisen in accommodating the general level of the
canal to the several levels of the feeding streams; for notwithstanding
all the favourable circumstances of the face of the
country, it has been found necessary in many places to cut
down to the depth of sixty or seventy feet below the surface; and,
in others, to raise mounds of earth upon lakes and swamps and
marshy grounds, of such a length and magnitude that nothing
short of the absolute command over multitudes could have ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>complished
an undertaking, whose immensity is only exceeded
by the great wall. These gigantic embankments are sometimes
carried through lakes of several miles in diameter, between
which the water is forced up to a height considerably
above that of the lake; and in such situations we sometimes observed
this enormous aqueduct gliding along at the rate of three
miles an hour. Few parts of it are level: in some places it has
little or no current; one day we had it setting to the southward at
the rate of one, two, or three miles an hour, the next to the northward,
and frequently on the same day we found it stationary,
and running in opposite directions. This balancing of the level
was effected by flood-gates thrown across at certain distances to
elevate or depress the height of the water a few inches, as might
appear to be necessary; and these stoppages are simply planks
sliding in grooves, that are cut into the sides of two stone abutments,
which in these places contract the canal to the width of
about thirty feet. There is not a lock nor, except these, a single
interruption to a continued navigation of six hundred miles.</p>

<p>The most remarkable parts of this extraordinary work will
be noticed in a following chapter, descriptive of our journey
through the empire.</p>

<p>Over this main trunk, and most of the other canals and rivers,
are a great variety of bridges, some with arches that are pointed
not unlike the gothic, some semicircular, and others shaped like a
horse-shoe: some have the piers of such an extraordinary height
that the largest vessels, of two hundred tons, sail under them
without striking their masts. Some of their bridges, of three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
five, and seven arches<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, that cross the canal, are extremely
light and beautiful to the eye, but the plan on which they are
usually constructed does not imply much strength. Each
stone, from five to ten feet in length, is cut so as to form a segment
of the arch, and as, in such cases, there is no key-stone,
ribs of wood fitted to the convexity of the arch are bolted
through the stones by iron bars, fixed fast into the solid parts of
the bridge. Sometimes, however, they are without wood, and
the curved stones are morticed into long transverse blocks of
stone, as in the annexed plate, which was drawn with great
accuracy by Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>There are, however, other arches wherein the stones are smaller
and pointed to a centre as in ours. I have understood from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>the late Captain Parish, that no masonry could be superior to
that of the great wall, and that all the arched and vaulted work
in the old towers was exceedingly well turned. This being
the case, we may probably be not far amiss in allowing the
Chinese to have employed this useful and ornamental part of
architecture before it was known to the Greeks and the Romans.
Neither the Egyptians nor the Persians appear at any time to
have applied it in their buildings. The ruins of Thebes and
of Persepolis have no arches, nor have those of Balbec and
Palmyra; nor do they seem to have been much used in the
magnificent buildings of the Romans antecedent to the time of
Augustus. The grand and elegant columns of all these nations
were connected by straight architraves of stone, of dimensions
not inferior to the columns themselves. In the Hindoo excavations
are arches cut out of the solid mountain; but when loose
stones were employed, and a building was intended to be superstructed
on columns, the stones above the capitals were overlaid
like inverted steps, till they met in a point in the middle above
the two columns, appearing at a little distance exactly like the
gothic arch, of which this might have given the first idea. If
then the antiquity be admitted which the Chinese ascribe to
the building of the great wall, and no reason but a negative one,
the silence of Marco Polo, has been offered against it (an objection
easily refuted), they have a claim to the invention of the
arch founded on no unsolid grounds.</p>

<p>The cemeteries, or repositories of the dead, exhibit a much
greater variety of monumental architecture than the dwellings
of the living can boast of. Some indeed deposit the remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
their ancestors in houses that differ in nothing from those they
inhabited while living, except in their diminutive size; others
prefer a square vault, ornamented in such a manner as fancy may
suggest; some make choice of a hexagon to cover the deceased,
and others of an octagon. The round, the triangular, the square,
and multangular column, is indifferently raised over the grave
of a Chinese; but the most common form of a monument to
the remains of persons of rank consists in three terraces, one
above another, inclosed by circular walls. The door or entrance
of the vault is in the centre of the uppermost terrace,
covered with an appropriate inscription; and figures of slaves
and horses and cattle, with other creatures that, when living,
were subservient to them and added to their pleasures, are employed
after their death to decorate the terraces of their
tombs.</p>

<p>It may be considered as superfluous, after what has been said,
to observe, that no branch of natural philosophy is made a
study, or a pursuit in China. The practical application of
some of the most obvious effects produced by natural causes
could not escape the observation of a people who had, at an
early period, attained so high a degree of civilization, but, satisfied
with the practical part, they pushed their enquiries no farther.
Of pneumatics, hydrostatics, electricity, and magnetism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
they may be said to have little or no knowledge; and their
optics extend not beyond the making of convex and concave
lenses of rock crystal to assist the sight in magnifying, or throwing
more rays upon, small objects and, by collecting to a focus
the rays of the sun, to set fire to combustible substances. These
lenses are cut with a saw and afterwards polished, the powder
of crystal being used in both operations. To polish diamonds
they make use of the powder of adamantine spar, or the corundum
stone. In cutting different kinds of stone into groups of
figures, houses, mountains, and sometimes into whole landscapes,
they discover more of persevering labour, of a determination
to subdue difficulties, which were not worth the subduing,
than real ingenuity. Among the many remarkable instances
of this kind of labour, there is one in the possession of
the Right Honourable Charles Greville, that deserves to be
noticed. It is a group of well formed, excavated, and highly
ornamented bottles, covered with foliage and figures, raised in
the manner of the antique <i>Cameos</i>, with moveable ring-handles,
standing on a base or pedestal, the whole cut out of one solid
block of clear rock crystal. Yet this laborious trifle was probably
sold for a few dollars in China. It was bought in London
for about thirty pounds, where it could not have been
made for many times that sum, if, indeed, it could have been
made at all. All their spectacles that I have seen were crystal
set in horn, tortoise-shell, or ivory. The single microscope is
in common use, but they have never hit upon the effect of approximating
objects by combining two or more lenses, a discovery
indeed to which in Europe we are more indebted to chance
than to the result of scientific enquiry. I observed at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
a rude kind of magic lantern, and a camera obscura,
neither of which, although evidently of Chinese workmanship,
appeared to wear the marks of a national invention. I should
rather conclude, that they were part of those striking and curious
experiments which the early Jesuits displayed at court, in order
to astonish the Emperor with their profound skill, and raise
their reputation as men of learning. Of the <i>ombres Chinoises</i>
they may, perhaps, claim the invention, and in pyrotechny
their ingenuity may be reckoned much superior to any thing
which has hitherto been exhibited in that art in Europe.</p>

<p>A convex lens is among the usual appendages to the tobacco
pipe. With these they are in the daily habit of lighting their
pipes. Hence the great burning lens made by Mr. Parker of
Fleet-Street, and carried out among the presents for the Emperor,
was an object that excited no admiration in the minds of
the Chinese. The difficulty of making a lens of such magnitude
perfect, or free from flaw, and its extraordinary powers
could not be understood, and consequently not appreciated by
them: and although in the short space of four seconds it completely
melted down one of their base copper coins, when the
sun was more than forty degrees beyond the meridian, it made
no impression of surprize on their uninformed minds. The
only enquiry they made about it was, whether the substance
was crystal; but being informed it was glass, they turned away
with a sort of disdain, as if they would say, Is a lump of glass a
proper present to offer to our great <i>Whang-tee</i>? The prime minister,
<i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, in order to convince us how very familiar
articles of such a nature were to him, lighted his pipe very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
composedly at the focus, but had a narrow escape from singeing
his sattin sleeve, which would certainly have happened had I
not given him a sudden push. He seemed, however, to be insensible
of his danger, and walked off without the least concern.</p>

<p>Indeed, in selecting the many valuable presents relating to
science, their knowledge and learning had been greatly overrated.
They had little esteem for what they could not comprehend,
and specimens of art served only to excite their jealousy,
and to wound their pride. Whenever a future embassy
shall be sent to Pekin, I should recommend articles of gold,
silver, and steel, children's toys and trinkets, and perhaps a
few specimens of Derbyshire spar, with the finest broad-cloth
and kerseymeres, in preference to all others; for in their present
state, they are totally incapable of appreciating any thing
great or excellent in the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>To alleviate the afflictions of mankind, and to assuage the
pains which the human frame is liable to suffer, must have
been among the earliest studies of civilized society; and accordingly,
in the history of ancient kingdoms, we find the practitioners
of the healing art regarded even to adoration. Chiron,
the preceptor of Achilles, and the master of Æsculapius,
was transferred to the heavens, where he still shines under the
name of Sagittarius. Among these nations, indeed, which we
call savage, there is usually shewn a more than ordinary respect
for such of their countrymen as are most skilled in removing
obstructions, allaying tumours, healing bruises, and, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
speaking, who can apply relief to misery. But the Chinese,
who seem to differ in their opinions from all the rest of mankind,
whether civilized or savage, pay little respect to the
therapeutick art. They have established no public schools for
the study of medicine, nor does the pursuit of it lead to honours,
rank, or fortune. Such as take up the profession are generally
of an inferior class; and the eunuchs about the palace are considered
among their best physicians. According to their own
account, the books on medicine escaped the fire, by which they
pretend the works of learning were consumed, in the reign of
<i>Shee-whang-tee</i>, two hundred years before the Christian era;
and yet the best of their medical books of the present day are
little better than mere herbals, specifying the names and enumerating
the qualities of certain plants. The knowledge of
these plants and of their supposed virtues goes a great way towards
constituting a physician. Those most commonly employed are
Gin-sing, rhubarb, and China-root. A few preparations are
also found in their pharmacop&oelig;ia from the animal and the mineral
kingdoms. In the former they employ snakes, beetles,
centipedes, and the aureliæ of the silk worm and other insects;
the meloe and the bee are used for blisters. In the latter, saltpetre,
sulphur, native cinnabar, and a few other articles are
occasionally prescribed. Opium is taken as a medicine, but
more generally as a cordial to exhilarate the spirits. Though the
importation of this drug is strictly prohibited, yet, as I have
before observed, vast quantities are annually smuggled into the
country from Bengal and from Europe, through the connivance
of the custom-house officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>The physiology of the human body, or the doctrine which
explains the constitution of man, is neither understood, nor
considered as necessary to be known; and their skill in pathology,
or in the causes and effects of diseases, is extremely limited,
very often absurd, and generally erroneous. The seat
of most diseases are, in fact, supposed to be discoverable by
feeling the pulse, agreeably to a system built upon principles
the most wild and extravagant. Having no knowledge whatsoever
of the circulation of the blood, notwithstanding the Jesuits
have made no scruple in asserting it was well known to
them long before Europeans had any idea of it, they imagine,
that every particular part of the human body has a particular
pulse assigned to it, and that these have all a corresponding and
sympathetic pulse in the arm; thus, they suppose one pulse to
be situated in the heart, another in the lungs, a third in the
kidneys, and so forth; and the skill of the doctor consists in discovering
the prevailing pulse in the body, by its sympathetic pulsations
in the arm; and the mummery made use of on such occasions
is highly ludicrous.</p>

<p>By eating too freely of unripe fruit at <i>Chu-san</i> I had a violent
attack of <i>cholera morbus</i>, and on application being made to
the governor for a little opium and rhubarb, he immediately
dispatched to me one of his physicians. With a countenance
as grave and a solemnity as settled, as ever was exhibited in a
consultation over a doubtful case in London or Edinburgh, he
fixed his eyes upon the ceiling, while he held my hand, beginning
at the wrist, and proceeding towards the bending of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the elbow, pressing sometimes hard with one finger, and then
light with another, as if he was running over the keys of a
harpsicord. This performance continued about ten minutes in
solemn silence, after which he let go my hand and pronounced
my complaint to have arisen from eating something that had
disagreed with the stomach. I shall not take upon me to decide
whether this conclusion was drawn from his skill in the
pulse, or from a conjecture of the nature of the complaint
from the medicines that had been demanded, and which met
with his entire approbation, or from a knowledge of the fact.</p>

<p>Le Compte, who had less reason to be cautious, from his
having left the country, than other missionaries who are doomed
to remain there for life, positively says, that the physicians always
endeavour to make themselves secretly acquainted with
the case of the patient, before they pronounce upon it, as their
reputation depends more on their assigning the true cause of the
disorder than on the cure. He then proceeds to tell a story of
a friend of his who, being troubled with a swelling, sent for a
Chinese physician. This gentleman told him very gravely,
that it was occasioned by a small worm which, unless extracted
by his skill, would ultimately produce gangrene and certain
death. Accordingly one day after the tumour, by the application
of a few poultices, was getting better, the doctor contrived
to drop upon the removed poultice a little maggot, for the extraction
of which he assumed to himself no small degree of
merit. Le Compte's stories, however, are not always to be
depended on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests are also a kind of doctors, and make plaisters for
a variety of purposes, some to draw out the disease to the part
applied, some as charms against the evil spirit, and others
which they pretend to be aphrodisiac; all of which, and
the last in particular, are in great demand among the wealthy.
In this respect the Chinese agree with most nations of antiquity,
whose priests were generally employed as physicians.
The number of quacks and venders of nostrums is immense in
every city who gain a livelihood by the credulity of the
multitude. One of this description exhibited in the public
streets of Canton a powder for sale as a specific for the bite of
a snake; and to convince the crowd of its immediate efficacy,
he carried with him a species of this reptile, whose bite was
known to be extremely venemous. He applied the mouth of
the animal to the tip of his tongue, which began to swell so
very rapidly, that in a few minutes the mouth was no longer
able to contain it. The intumescence continued till it seemed
to burst, and exhibited a shocking sight of foam and blood,
during which the quack appeared in extreme agonies, and excited
the commiseration of all the bye-standers. In the height
of the paroxysm he applied a little of his powder to the nose
and the inflamed member, after which it gradually subsided,
and the disorder disappeared. Though the probability in the
city of any one person being bit with a snake was not less
perhaps than a hundred thousand to one, yet every person present
bought of the miraculous powder, till a sly fellow maliciously
suggested that the whole of this scene might probably
have been performed by means of a bladder concealed in the
mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>But the usual remedy for the bite of a snake is a topical application
of sulphur, or the bruised head of the same animal
that gave the wound. The coincidence of such an extravagant
idea among nations as remote from each other as the equator
from the pole is sufficiently remarkable. A Roman poet
observes,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 38%;">
<div class="poem">
"Quum nocuit serpens, fertur caput illius apte<br />
Vulneribus jungi: sanat quem sauciat ipsa."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>Q. Serenus de Medicina.</i></span><br />
<br />
If to a serpent's bite its head be laid,<br />
'Twill heal the wound which by itself was made.<br />
</div></div>

<p>The naked legs of the Hottentots are frequently stung by scorpions,
and they invariably endeavour to catch the animal, which
they bruise and apply to the wound, being confident of the
cure; the Javanese, or inhabitants of Java, are fully persuaded
of the efficacy of such application; and the author above quoted
observes with regard to the sting of this insect,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 38%;">
<div class="poem">
"Vulneribusque aptus, fertur revocare venenum."<br />
<br />
Being applied to the wound, it is said to draw out the poison.<br />
</div></div>

<p>As it is a violation of good morals for a gentleman to be seen
in company with ladies, much more so to touch the hands of
the fair, the faculty rather than lose a fee, though it commonly
amounts only to fifty <i>tchen</i>, or the twentieth part of six shillings
and eight-pence, have contrived an ingenious way of feeling a
lady's pulse: a silken cord being made fast to the wrist of the
patient is passed through a hole in the wainscot into another
apartment where the doctor, applying his hand to the cord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
after a due observance of solemn mockery, decides upon the
case and prescribes accordingly. About court, however, a particular
class of eunuchs only are entrusted with feeling the pulse
of the ladies.</p>

<p>The crowded manner in which the common people live together
in small apartments in all the cities, the confined streets
and, above all, the want of cleanliness in their persons, beget
sometimes contagious diseases that sweep off whole families,
similar to the plague. In Pekin incredible numbers perish in
these contagious fevers, which more frequently happen there
than in other parts of the empire, notwithstanding the moderate
temperature of the climate. In the southern provinces they are
neither so general, nor so fatal as might be expected, owing, I
believe, in a very great degree, to the universal custom among
the mass of the people of wearing vegetable substances next the
skin which, being more cleanly, are consequently more wholesome
than clothing made from animal matter. Thus, linen
and cotton are preferable to silk and woollen next the skin,
which should be worn only by persons of the most cleanly habits.
Another antidote to the ill effects that might be expected
from want of cleanliness in their houses and their persons, is the
constant ventilation kept up in the former both by day and
night: during warm weather, they have no other door but an
open matted skreen, and the windows are either entirely open
or of thin paper only. Notwithstanding their want of personal
cleanliness, they are little troubled with leprous or cutaneous
diseases, and they pretend to be totally ignorant of gout, stone,
or gravel, which they ascribe to the preventive effects of tea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
In favour of this opinion, it has been observed by some of our
physicians, that since the introduction of tea into common use,
cutaneous diseases have become much more rare in Great Britain
than they were before that period, which others have
ascribed, perhaps with more propriety, to the general use of
linen; both, however, may have been instrumental in producing
the happy effect.</p>

<p>The ravages of the small-pox, wherever they make their appearance,
are attended with a general calamity. Of these they
pretend to distinguish above forty different species, to each of
which they have given a particular name. If a good sort breaks
out, inoculation or, more properly speaking, infection by artificial
means becomes general. The usual way of communicating
the disease is by inserting the matter, contained in a little
cotton wool, into the nostrils, or they put on the clothes of, or
sleep in the same bed with, such as may have had a favourable
kind; but they never introduce the matter by making any incision
in the skin. This fatal disease, as appears from the records
of the empire, was unknown before the tenth century,
when it was perhaps introduced by the Mahomedans of Arabia
who, at that period, carried on a considerable commerce with
Canton from the Persian gulph, and who not long before had
received it from the Saracens, when they invaded and conquered
the Eastern Empire. The same disease was likewise one
of those blessings which the mad crusades conferred upon Europe;
since which time, to the close of the eighteenth century,
not a hope had been held out of its extirpation when, happily,
the invaluable discovery of the cow-pock, or rather the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
application of that discovery, which had long been confined to
a particular district, has furnished abundant grounds to hope,
that this desirable event may now be accomplished.</p>

<p>In some of the provinces the lower orders of people are said
to be dreadfully afflicted with sore eyes, and this endemic complaint
has been supposed to proceed from the copious use of
rice; a conjecture, apparently, without any kind of foundation,
as the Hindus and other Indian nations, whose whole diet
consists almost exclusively of this grain, are not particularly
subject to the like disease: and in Egypt, both in ancient and
modern times, the opthalmia and blindness were much more
prevalent than in China; yet rice was neither cultivated nor
known in that part of Africa until the reign of the caliphs,
when it was introduced from the eastward. The disease in
China, if prevalent there, may more probably be owing to
their living in crowded and low habitations, wherein there is a
perpetual smoke from the fire, from tapers made of sandal wood
dust employed for marking the divisions of the day, from the
general use of tobacco, and from the miasma or noxious vapours
exhaling from the dirt and offals which are collected in or
near their habitations. The organ of sight may also be relaxed,
and rendered more susceptible of disease, by the constant practice
of washing the face, even in the middle of summer, with
warm water. I must observe, however, that in the course of
our long journey, we saw very few blind people, or persons
afflicted with sore eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>It will readily be inferred, from the short view which has
been taken of the state of society, that the disease occasioned by
an unrestrained and promiscuous intercourse of the sexes cannot
be very common in China. In fact, it is scarcely known,
and the treatment of it is so little understood, in the few cases
which do occur, that it is allowed to work its way into the
system, and is then considered by them as an incurable leprosy.
On arriving at the northern extremity of the province of Canton,
one of our conductors had imprudently passed the night in
one of those houses where, by the license of government, females
are allowed to prostitute their persons in order to gain a
livelihood. Here, it seems, he had caught the infection, and
after suffering a considerable degree of pain, and not less alarm,
he communicated to our physician the symptoms of his
complaint, of the nature and cause of which he was entirely
ignorant. He was a man of forty years, of a vigorous constitution
and a gay cheerful temper, and had served as an officer
in several campaigns from the different provinces of northern
Tartary to the frontiers of India, yet such a disease did not
consist with his knowledge. From this circumstance, and
many others of a similar kind, I conclude that, although it may
sometimes make its appearance in the capital, and even here
but very rarely, it has originally, and no long time ago, found
its way thither through the ports of Chu-san, Canton, and
Macao, where numbers of abandoned woman obtain their subsistence
by selling their favours to such of every nation as may
be disposed to purchase them. It is, in fact, sometimes called
by the Chinese the <i>Canton-ulcer</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>No male physician is ever allowed to prescribe for pregnant
women; and they consider it so great a breach of delicacy for
a man to be in the same room with a woman when in labour
that, whatever difficulties may occur, the case is left entirely to
the woman who attends her. There is not a man-midwife in
all China, and yet the want of them does not appear to be injurious
to population. They could scarcely believe it possible
that, in Europe, men should be allowed to practice a profession
which, in their minds, belonged exclusively to the other sex.</p>

<p>As a due knowledge of the organization of the human body, of
the powers and functions of the several parts, is attainable only
by the study of practical anatomy, a study that would shock the
weak nerves of a timid Chinese, it will not be expected that
their surgical operations should either be numerous or neatly
performed. The law indeed which I have had occasion to notice,
and the effects produced by it in two or three instances
that occurred to our knowledge, will sufficiently explain the
very low ebb of chirurgical skill. No one will readily undertake
to perform the most simple operation, where not only all
the direct consequences, but the contingencies for forty days
must lie at his door. They sometimes succeed in reducing a
dislocation, and in setting a simple fracture; but in difficult
and complicated cases, the patient is generally abandoned to
chance. Amputation is never practised. In the course of our
whole journey, wherein we passed through millions of people,
I do not recollect to have seen a single individual that had sustained
the loss of a limb, and but very few in any way maimed;
from whence I conclude, that accidents are uncommon, or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
serious ones usually terminate in the loss of life. A Chinese is
so dreadfully afraid of a sharp cutting instrument, that he has
not even submitted to the operation of blood-letting; though
the principle is admitted, as they are in the practice of drawing
blood by scarifying the skin, and applying cupping vessels. In
certain complaints they burn the skin with small pointed irons
made hot, and sometimes, after puncturing the part with silver
needles, they set fire to the leaves of a species of Artemisia upon
it, in the same manner as the Moxa in Japan is made use of to
cure and even prevent a number of diseases, but especially the
gout and rheumatism, the former of which is said to be unknown
in China. Cleansing the ears, cutting corns, pulling the joints
till they crack, twitching the nose, thumping on the back, and
such like operations, are annexed to the shaving profession, by
which thousands in every city gain a livelihood. In short, the
whole medical skill of the Chinese may be summed up in the
words of the ingenious Doctor Gregory from the information
he obtained from his friend Doctor Gillan. "In the greatest,
most ancient, and most civilized empire on the face of the
earth, an empire that was great, populous, and highly civilized
two thousand years ago, when this country was as savage
as New Zealand is at present, no such good medical
aid can be obtained among the people of it, as a smart
boy of sixteen, who had been but twelve months apprentice
to a good and well employed Edinburgh Surgeon,
might reasonably be expected to afford." "If," continues
the Doctor, "the Emperor of China, the absolute
monarch of three hundred and thirty-three millions of
people, more than twice as many as all Europe contains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
were attacked with a pleurisy, or got his leg broken, it
would be happy for him to get such a boy for his first physician
and serjeant-surgeon. The boy (if he had seen his
master's practice in but one or two similar cases) would certainly
know how to set his Imperial Majesty's leg, and would
probably cure him of his pleurisy, which none of his own subjects
could do."</p>

<p>Having thus given a slight sketch of the state of some of the
leading branches in science, arts, and manufactures, omitting
purposely that of agriculture, which will be noticed among the
subjects of a future section, I think, upon the whole, it may
fairly be concluded, that the Chinese have been among the
first nations, now existing in the world, to arrive at a certain
pitch of perfection, where, from the policy of the government,
or some other cause, they have remained stationary:
that they were civilized, fully to the same extent they now are,
more than two thousand years ago, at a period when all Europe
might be considered, comparatively, as barbarous; but that
they have since made little progress in any thing, and been retrograde
in many things: that, at this moment, compared with
Europe, they can only be said to be great in trifles, whilst they
are really trifling in every thing that is great. I cannot however
exactly subscribe to an opinion pronounced on them by a
learned and elegant writer<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, who was well versed in oriental literature,
as being rather too unqualified; but he was less acquainted
with their character than that of any other Asiatic nation, and
totally ignorant of their language. "Their letters," says he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>"if we may so call them, are merely the symbols of ideas;
their philosophy seems yet in so rude a state, as hardly to
deserve the appellation; they have no ancient monuments
from which their origin can be traced, even by plausible conjecture;
their sciences are wholly exotic; and their mechanical
arts have nothing in them characteristic of a particular
family; nothing which any set of men, in a country so highly
favoured by nature, might not have discovered and improved."</p>

acquainted with the existence even of that vast extent of country
comprehended under the name of China, the difficulties of
access to any part of it when known, the peculiar nature of
the language which, as I have endeavoured to prove, has no
relation with any other either ancient or modern, the extreme
jealousy of the government towards foreigners, and the contempt
in which they were held by the lowest of the people, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
serve, among other causes, to account for the very limited and
imperfect knowledge we have hitherto obtained of the real history
of this extraordinary empire: for their records, it seems,
are by no means deficient. For two centuries at least before
the Christian era, down to the present time, the transactions of
each reign are amply detailed without any interruption. They
have even preserved collections of copper coins, forming a regular
series of the different Emperors that have filled the throne
of China for the last two thousand years. Such a collection,
though not quite complete, Sir George Staunton brought with
him to England.</p>

<p>Before this time, when China consisted of a number of petty
states or principalities, the annals of the country are said to
abound with recitals of wars and battles and bloodshed, like
those of every other part of the world. But, in proportion as
the number of those distinct kingdoms diminished, till at length
they were all melted and amalgamated into one great empire,
the destruction of the human race by human means abated, and
the government, since that time, has been less interrupted by foreign
war, or domestic commotion, than any other that history
has made known. But whether this desirable state of public
tranquillity may have been brought about by the peculiar nature
of the government being adapted to the genius and habits of the
people, which in the opinion of Aristotle is the best of all
possible governments, or rather by constraining and subduing
the genius and habits of the people to the views and maxims of
the government, is a question that may admit of some dispute.
At the present day, however, it is sufficiently evident, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the heavy hand of power has completely overcome and moulded
to its own shape the physical character of the people, and that
their moral sentiments and actions are swayed by the opinions,
and almost under the entire dominion, of the government.</p>

<p>These opinions, to which it owes so much of its stability, are
grounded on a principle of authority which, according to
maxims industriously inculcated and now completely established
in the minds of the people, is considered as the natural and unalienable
right of the parent over his children; an authority
that is not supposed to cease at any given period of life or years,
but to extend, and to be maintained with undiminished and uncontrouled
sway, until the death of one of the parties dissolves
the obligation. The Emperor being considered as the common
father of his people is accordingly invested with the exercise of
the same authority over them, as the father of a family exerts
on those of his particular household. In this sense he takes the
title of the <i>Great Father</i>; and by his being thus placed above
any earthly controul, he is supposed to be also above earthly
descent, and therefore, as a natural consequence, he sometimes
styles himself the <i>sole ruler of the world</i> and the <i>Son of Heaven</i>.
But that no inconsistency might appear in the grand fabric of
filial obedience the Emperor, with solemn ceremony at the commencement
of every new year, makes his prostrations before
the Empress Dowager, and on the same day he demands a repetition
of the same homage from all his great officers of state.
Conformable to this system, founded entirely on parental authority,
the governor of a province is considered as the father
of that province; of a city, the father of that city; and the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of any office or department is supposed to preside over it with
the same authority, interest, and affection, as the father of a
family superintends and manages the concerns of domestic
life.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be lamented that a system of government, so
plausible in theory, should be liable to so many abuses in practice;
and that this fatherly care and affection in the governors,
and filial duty and reverence in the governed would, with
much more propriety, be expressed by the terms of tyranny,
oppression, and injustice in the one, and by fear, deceit, and
disobedience in the other.</p>

<p>The first grand maxim on which the Emperor acts is, seldom
to appear before the public, a maxim whose origin would be
difficultly traced to any principle of affection or solicitude for
his children; much more easily explained as the offspring of
suspicion. The tyrant who may be conscious of having committed,
or assented to, acts of cruelty and oppression, must feel
a reluctance to mix with those who may have smarted under
the lash of his power, naturally concluding that some secret hand
may be led, by a single blow, to avenge his own wrongs, or
those of his fellow subjects. The principle, however, upon
which the Emperor of China seldom shews himself in public,
and then only in the height of splendor and magnificence, seems
to be established on a policy of a very different kind to that of
self-preservation. A power that acts in secret, and whose influence
is felt near and remote at the same moment, makes a
stronger impression on the mind, and is regarded with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
dread and awful respect, than if the agent was always visible
and familiar to the eye of every one. The priests of the Eleusinian
mysteries were well acquainted with this feature of the
human character, which is stronger in proportion as the reasoning
faculties are less improved, and which required the enlightened
mind of a Socrates to be able to disregard the terror they
inspired among the vulgar. Thus also <i>Dei&#333;ces</i>, as Heredotus
informs us, when once established as king in Ecbatana, would
suffer none of the people, for whom before he was the common
advocate, to be now admitted to his presence, concluding that all
those who were debarred from seeing him, would easily be persuaded
that his nature, by being created king, was transformed
into something much superior to theirs. A frequent access indeed
to men of rank and power and talents, a familiar and unrestrained
intercourse with them, and a daily observance of their
ordinary actions and engagements in the concerns of life, have
a tendency very much to diminish that reverence and respect
which public opinion had been willing to allow them. It was
justly observed by the great Condé, that no man is a hero to his
valet-de-chambre.</p>

<p>Considerations of this kind, rather than any dread of his subjects,
may probably have suggested the custom which prohibits
an Emperor of China from making his person too familiar to
the multitude, and which requires that he should exhibit himself
only on particular occasions, arrayed in pomp and magnificence,
and at the head of his whole court, consisting of an assemblage
of many thousand officers of state, the agents of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
will, all ready, at the word of command, to prostrate themselves
at his feet.</p>

<p>The power of the sovereign is absolute; but the patriarchal
system, making it a point of indispensable duty for a son to
bring offerings to the spirit of his deceased parent in the most
public manner, operates as some check upon the exercise of this
power. By this civil institution, the duties of which are observed
with more than a religious strictness, he is constantly
put in mind that the memory of his private conduct, as well
as of his public acts, will long survive his natural life; that his
name will, at certain times in every year, be pronounced with a
kind of sacred and reverential awe, from one extremity of the extensive
empire to the other, provided he may have filled his station
to the satisfaction of his subjects; and that, on the contrary,
public execrations will rescue from oblivion any arbitrary act of
injustice and oppression, of which he may have been guilty. It
may also operate as a motive for being nice and circumspect in
the nomination of a successor, which the law has left entirely to
his choice.</p>

<p>The consideration, however, of posthumous fame, would
operate only as a slender restraint on the caprices of a tyrant, as
the history of this, as well as other countries, furnishes abundant
examples. It has, therefore, been thought necessary to add
another, and perhaps a more effectual check, to curb any disposition
to licentiousness or tyranny that might arise in the
breast of the monarch. This is the appointment of the Censo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>rate,
an office filled by two persons, who have the power of remonstrating
freely against any illegal or unconstitutional act
about to be committed, or sanctioned by the Emperor. And
although it may well be supposed, that these men are extremely
cautious in the exercise of the power delegated to them, by virtue
of their office, and in the discharge of this disagreeable part
of their duty, yet they have another task to perform, on which
their own posthumous fame is not less involved than that of
their master, and in the execution of which they run less risk
of giving offence. They are the historiographers of the empire;
or, more correctly speaking, the biographers of the Emperor.
Their employment, in this capacity, consists chiefly in
collecting the sentiments of the monarch, in recording his
speeches and memorable sayings, and in noting down the most
prominent of his private actions, and the remarkable occurrences
of his reign. These records are lodged in a large chest,
which is kept in that part of the palace where the tribunals of
government are held, and which is supposed not to be opened until
the decease of the Emperor; and, if any thing material to the
injury of his character and reputation is found to be recorded,
the publication of it is delayed, out of delicacy to his family, till
two or three generations have passed away, and sometimes till
the expiration of the dynasty; by that indulgence they pretend,
that a more faithful relation is likely to be obtained, in which
neither fear nor flattery could have operated to disguise the
truth.</p>

<p>An institution, so remarkable and singular in its kind in an
arbitrary government, could not fail to carry with it a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
powerful influence upon the decisions of the monarch, and to
make him solicitous to act, on all occasions, in such a manner,
as would be most likely to secure a good name, and to transmit
his character unsullied and sacred to posterity. The records of
their history are said to mention a story of an Emperor, of the
dynasty or family of <i>Tang</i>, who, from a consciousness of having,
in several instances, transgressed the bounds of his authority,
was determined to take a peep into the historical chest,
where he knew he should find all his actions recorded. Having
made use of a variety of arguments, in order to convince the
two censors that there could be nothing improper in the step he
was about to take, as, among other things, he assured them,
he was actuated with the desire only of being made acquainted
with his greatest faults, as the first step to amendment,
one of these gentlemen is said to have answered him very
nobly, to this effect: "It is true your Majesty has committed a
number of errors, and it has been the painful duly of our
employment to take notice of them; a duty," continued he,
"which further obliges us to inform posterity of the conversation
which your Majesty has this day, very improperly,
held with us."</p>

<p>To assist the Emperor in the weighty affairs of state, and in
the arduous task of governing an empire of so great an extent,
and such immense population, the constitution has assigned him
two councils, one ordinary, and the other extraordinary; the ordinary
council is composed of his principal ministers, under the
name of Collao, of which there are six. The extraordinary
council consists entirely of the princes of the blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>For the administration of the affairs of government, there
are six boards or departments, consisting of,</p>

<p>1. The Court of Appointments to vacancies in the offices
of government, being composed of the minister and
learned men, qualified to judge of the merits of candidates.</p>

<p>2. The Court of Finance.</p>

<p>3. The Court of Ceremonies, presiding over the direction of
ancient customs, and treating with foreign Embassadors.</p>

<p>4. The Court for regulating military affairs.</p>

<p>5. The Tribunal of Justice.</p>

<p>6. The Board of Works.</p>

<p>These public functionaries resolve upon, recommend, and
report to the Emperor, all matters belonging to their separate
jurisdictions, who, with the advice of his ordinary and, if considered
to be necessary, of his extraordinary council, affirms,
amends, or rejects their decrees. For this purpose, the late
Emperor never omitted to give regular audience in the great hall
of the palace every morning at the hours of four or five o'clock.
Subordinate to these supreme courts held in the capital, are
others of similar constitution established in the different pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>vinces
and great cities of the empire, each of which corresponds
with its principal in Pekin.</p>

<p>It would far exceed the limits of the present work, were I to
enter into a detail of their code of laws, which indeed I am not
sufficiently prepared to do. They are published for the use of
the subject, in the plainest characters that the language will admit,
making sixteen small volumes, a copy of which is now
in England; and I am encouraged to hold out a reasonable
hope, that this compendium of the laws of China may, ere
long, appear in an able and faithful English translation, which
will explain, more than all the volumes that have hitherto
been written on the subject of China, in what manner a mass
of people, more than the double of that which is found in all
Europe, has been kept together through so many ages in one
bond of union. This work<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> on the laws of China, for perspicuity
and method, may justly be compared with Blackstone's
Commentaries on the Laws of England. It not only contains
the laws arranged under their respective heads, but to every
law is added a short commentary and a case.</p>

<p>I have been assured, on the best authority, that the laws of
China define, in the most distinct and perspicuous manner, almost
every shade of criminal offences, and the punishment
awarded to each crime: that the greatest care appears to have
been taken in constructing this scale of crimes and punishments;
that they are very far from being sanguinary: and that if
the practice was equal to the theory, few nations could boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of a more mild, and, at the same time, a more efficacious dispensation
of justice. Of all the despotic governments existing,
there is certainly none where the life of man is held so sacred
as in the laws of China. A murder is never overlooked, except
in the horrid practice of exposing infants: nor dares the Emperor
himself, all-powerful as he is, to take away the life of
the meanest subject, without the formality at least of a regular
process, though, as will be seen in the case of the late prime
minister of <i>Kien-Long</i>, the chance of escaping must be very
slender, where he himself becomes the accuser. So tenaciously
however do they adhere to that solemn declaration of God delivered
to Noah&mdash;"At the hand of every man's brother will I
require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by
man shall his blood be shed,"&mdash;that the good intention is
oftentimes defeated by requiring, as I have elsewhere observed,
from the person last seen in company with one who may have
received a mortal wound, or who may have died suddenly, a
circumstantial account, supported by evidence, in what manner
his death was occasioned.</p>

<p>In attempting to proportion punishments to the degrees of
crimes, indeed of awarding the same punishment for stealing a
loaf of bread and taking away the life of man, the Chinese
legislators, according to our notions, seem to have made too
little distinction between accidental manslaughter and premeditated
murder. To constitute the crime, it is not necessary to
prove the intention or malice aforethought; for though want of
intention palliates the offence, and consequently mitigates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
punishment, yet it never entirely excuses the offender. If a
man should kill another by an unforeseen and unavoidable accident,
his life is forfeited by the law, and however favourable
the circumstances may appear in behalf of the criminal, the
Emperor alone is invested with the power of remitting the sentence,
a power which he very rarely if ever exercises to
the extent of a full pardon but, on many occasions, to a
mitigation of the punishment awarded by law. Strictly speaking,
no sentence of death can be carried into execution until it
has been ratified by the monarch. Yet in state crimes, or in
acts of great atrocity, the viceroy of a province sometimes takes
upon himself to order summary punishment, and prompt execution
has been inflicted on foreign criminals at Canton when
guilty only of homicide. Thus, about the beginning of the last
century, a man belonging to Captain Shelvocke had the misfortune
to kill a Chinese on the river. The corpse was laid before
the door of the English factory, and the first person that
came out, who happened to be one of the supercargoes, was
seized and carried as a prisoner into the city, nor would they
consent to his release till the criminal was given up, whom, after
a short inquiry, they strangled. The recent affair of the
unfortunate gunner is well known. An affray happened in Macao
a few years ago, in which a Chinese was killed by the Portuguese.
A peremptory demand was made for one of the latter,
to expiate the death of the former. The government of
this place, either unable or unwilling to fix on the delinquent,
proposed terms of compromise, which were rejected and force
was threatened to be used. There happened to be a merchant
from Manilla then residing at Macao, a man of excellent cha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>racter,
who had long carried on a commerce between the two
ports. This unfortunate man was selected to be the innocent
victim to appease the rigour of Chinese justice, and he was immediately
strangled<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>The process of every trial for criminal offences, of which the
punishment is capital, must be transmitted to Pekin, and submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>ted
to the impartial eye of the supreme tribunal of justice, which
affirms or alters, according to the nature of the case. And
where any peculiar circumstances appear in favour of the accused,
an order for revising the sentence is recommended to the
Emperor, who, in such cases, either amends it himself, or directs
the proceedings to be returned to the provincial court,
with the sentiments of the supreme tribunal on the case. The
proceedings are then revised, and if the circumstances are
found to apply to the suggestions of the high court, they alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
or modify their former sentence accordingly<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>As in some of the Grecian states, and other nations of modern
times, the punishment of treason was extended to the relations
of the criminal, so in China, even to the ninth genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>tion,
a traitor's blood is supposed to be tainted, though they
usually satisfy the law by including only the nearest male relations,
then living, in the guilt of the culprit, and by mitigating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
their punishment to that of exile. Nothing can be more unjust
and absurd, however politic, than such a law, absurd, because
it considers a non-entity capable of committing a crime; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
unjust, because it punishes an innocent person. The lawgiver
of Israel, in order to intimidate his stiff-necked and rebellious
subjects, found it expedient to threaten the visitation of God on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the children, for the sins of the fathers, unto the third and
fourth generation, a sentiment however which, it would seem,
lapse of time had rendered less expedient, for the prophet Eze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>kiel,
who on this subject had more elevated notions of moral
right than either the Greeks or the Chinese, spurns it with
great indignation. In allusion to such an idea, which it seems
had become a proverb among the Jews, he breaks out into this
sublime exclamation: "What mean ye that ye use this proverb
concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have
eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
As I live, saith the Lord, ye shall not have occasion any
more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold all souls are
mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, is
mine. The soul that sinneth, <i>it</i> shall die. The son shall not
bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear
the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous
shall be upon <i>him</i>, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be
upon <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>In most causes, except those of high treason, it may be presumed,
the high tribunal of Pekin will act with strict impar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>tiality.
And it is greatly to be lamented, that all civil causes
have not been made subject to a similar revision as those of a
criminal nature, which would strike at the root of an evil that
is most grievously felt in China, where the officers of justice are
known, in most cases, to be corrupted by bribery. They have,
however, wisely separated the office of judge from that of the
legislator. The former, having found the fact, has only to refer
to the code of laws, in which he is supplied with a scale of
crimes and their punishments. Such a mode of distributing
justice is not however without its inconveniences. Tender as
the government has shewn itself, where the life of a subject is
concerned, having once established the proportion of punishment
to the offence it has supposed an appeal, in civil
causes and misdemeanors, to be unnecessary. The sentence in
such causes being thus left in the breast of a single judge, how
great soever may be the nicety by which the penalty is adapted
to the offence, the exclusion from appeal is in itself a bar to the
just and impartial administration of the laws. The subject being
refused the benefit of carrying his cause into a higher, and
on that account more likely to be a more impartial, court, has
no security against the caprice, malice, or corruption of his
judge.</p>

<p>It may not perhaps be thought unworthy of notice that the
legislators of China, among the various punishments devised for
the commission of crimes, have given the criminal no opportunity,
either by labouring at any of the public works, or in
solitary confinement, to make some reparation for the injury
he has committed against society. Confinement in prison, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
punishment, is not known. Exile or personal chastisement
are decreed for all irregularities not approaching to capital
offences.</p>

<p>Executions for capital crimes are not frequently exhibited;
when found guilty the criminals are remanded to prison till a
general gaol delivery, which happens once a year, about the
autumnal equinox. In adopting such a measure government
may perhaps have considered, how little benefit the morals of
the people were likely to derive from being the frequent
spectators of the momentary pain that is required to take away
the existence of a fellow mortal. All other punishments, however,
that do not affect the life of man, are made as public as
possible, and branded with the greatest degree of notoriety.
The beating with the bamboo, in their ideas, scarcely ranks
under the name of punishment, being more properly considered
as a gentle correction, to which no disgrace is attached, but the
cangue or, as they term it, the <i>tcha</i>, a kind of walking pillory,
is a heavy tablet of wood, to which they are fastened by the
neck and hands, and which they are sometimes obliged to drag
about for weeks and months; this is a terrible punishment,
and well calculated to deter others from the commission of
those crimes of which it is the consequence, and the nature
of which is always inscribed in large characters upon it.</p>

<p>The order that is kept in their jails is said to be excellent,
and the debtor and the felon are always confined in separate
places; as indeed one should suppose every where to be the
case, for, as Sir George Staunton has observed, "To associate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
guilt with imprudence, and confound wickedness with misfortune,
is impolitic, immoral, and cruel<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>."</p>

<p>The abominable practice of extorting confession by the application
of the torture is the worst part of the criminal laws
of China; but they pretend to say this mode is seldom recurred
to, unless in cases where the guilt of the accused has been made
to appear by strong circumstantial evidence. It is however a
common punishment to squeeze the fingers in cases of misdemeanour,
and is particularly practised as a punishment of those
females who purchase licences for breaking through the rules
of chastity.</p>

<p>By the laws relating to property, women in China, as in
ancient Rome, are excluded from inheriting, where there are
children, and from disposing of property; but where there are
no male children a man may leave, by will, the whole of his
property to the widow. The reason they assign for women
not inheriting is, that a woman can make no offering to deceased
relations in the hall of ancestors; and it is deemed one of the
first ideal blessings of life for a man to have some one to look
up to, who will transmit his name to future ages, by performing,
at certain fixed periods, the duties of this important
ceremony. All their laws indeed respecting property, as I
have already observed, are insufficient to give it that security
and stability which alone can constitute the pleasure of accumulating
wealth. The avarice of men in power may overlook
those who are in moderate circumstances, but the affluent rarely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>escape their rapacious grasp. In a word, although the laws
are not so perfect as to procure for the subject general good,
yet neither are they so defective as to reduce him to that state
of general misery, which could only be terminated in a revolution.
The executive administration is so faulty, that the man
in office generally has it in his power to govern the laws,
which makes the measure of good or evil depend greatly on his
moral character.</p>

<p>Such are indeed the disposition and the habits of the people,
that so long as the multitude can procure their bowl of rice
and a few savory sauces, that cost only a mere trifle, there will
be less danger of a revolt; and the government is so well convinced
of this, that one of its first concerns is to lay up, in the
public magazines erected in every part of the empire, a provision
of grain, to serve as a supply for the poor in times of
famine or scarcity. In this age of revolutions, a change, however,
seems to be taking place in the minds of the people, which
I shall presently notice.</p>

<p>The system of universal and implicit obedience towards
superiors pervades every branch of the public service. The
officers of the several departments of government, from the first
to the ninth degree, acting upon the same broad basis of
paternal authority, are invested with the power of inflicting the
summary punishment of the bamboo, on all occasions where
they may judge it proper, which, under the denomination of
a fatherly correction, they administer without any previous
trial, or form of inquiry. The slightest offence is punishable
in this manner, at the will or the caprice of the lowest ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>gistrate.
Such a summary proceeding of the powerful against
the weak naturally creates in the latter a dread and distrust of
the former; and the common people, accordingly, regard the
approach of a man in office, just as schoolboys observe the
motions of a severe master; but the fatherly kindness of the
Emperor is recognised even in punishment; the culprit may
claim the exemption of every fifth blow as the Emperor's <i>coup-de-grace</i>;
but in all probability he gains little by such remission,
as the deficiency in number may easily be made up in weight.</p>

<p>This practical method of evincing a fatherly affection is not
confined to the multitude alone, but is extended to every rank
and description of persons, ceasing only at the foot of the
throne. Each officer of state, from the ninth degree upwards
to the fourth, can, at any time, administer a gentle correction
to his inferior; and the Emperor orders the bamboo to his
ministers, and to the other four classes, whenever he may think
it necessary for the good of their morals. It is well known
that the late <i>Kien Long</i> caused two of his sons to be bambooed
long after they had arrived at the age of maturity, one of which,
I believe, is the present reigning Emperor.</p>

<p>In travelling through the country, a day seldom escaped
without our witnessing the application of the <i>Pan-tsé</i> or bamboo,
and generally in such a manner that it might be called by
any other name except a <i>gentle</i> correction. A Chinese suffering
under this punishment cries out in the most piteous manner;
a Tartar bears it in silence. A Chinese, after receiving a certain
number of strokes, falls down on his knees, as a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of course, before him who ordered the punishment, thanking
him, in the most humble manner, for the fatherly kindness he
has testified towards his son, in thus putting him in mind of
his errors; a Tartar grumbles, and disputes the point as to the
right that a Chinese may have to flog him; or he turns away in
sullen silence.</p>

<p>Ridiculous as it may appear to a foreigner, in observing an
officer of state stretching himself along the ground for the purpose
of being flogged by order of another who happens to rank
one degree above him; yet it is impossible, at the same time,
to suppress a glow of indignation, in witnessing so mean and
obsequious a degradation of the human mind, which can bring
itself, under any circumstances, patiently to submit to a vile
corporal punishment, administered by the hand of a slave, or by
a common soldier; and when this is done, to undergo the still
more vile and humiliating act of kissing the rod that corrects
him. But the policy of the government has taken good care
to remove any scruples that might arise on this score. Where
paternal regard was the sole motive, such a chastisement could
not possibly be followed with dishonour or disgrace. It was a
wonderful point gained by the government, to subject every
individual, the Emperor only excepted, to the same corporal
correction; but it must have required great address, and men's
minds must have been completely subdued, or completely convinced,
before such a system of universal obedience could have
been accomplished, the consequence of which, it was obvious,
could be no other than universal servility. It could not fail to
establish a most effectual check against the complaints of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
multitude, by shewing them that the same man, who had the
power of punishing them, was equally liable to be corrected in
his turn, and in the same manner, by another. The punishment
of the bamboo must, I suspect, be one of the most ancient
institutions of China. Indeed we can scarcely conceive it
ever to have been introduced into a society already civilized;
but rather to have been coeval with the origin of that society.</p>

<p>A similar kind of personal chastisement for light offences,
or misconduct, was inflicted in Russia on persons of all ranks,
but with this difference, that the correction was private and
by order of the Sovereign alone. The Czar Peter, indeed,
generally bestowed a drubbing on his courtiers with his own
hand; who, instead of being dishonoured or disgraced by such
a castigation, were supposed, from that very circumstance, to
be his particular favourites, and to stand high in his confidence.
The great Mentzikoff is said to have frequently left his closet
with a black eye or a bloody nose; and seemed to derive encreasing
importance from the unequivocal marks of his master's
friendship. Even at the present day, or till very lately, little
disgrace was attached to the punishment of the <i>knout</i>, which was
a private flagellation by order of the court; but this abominable
practice either is altogether discontinued, or in its last stage of
existence. Such arbitrary proceedings could not long remain
in force among an enlightened people.</p>

<p>These two great empires, the greatest indeed that exist in
the world, dividing between them nearly a fifth part of the
whole habitable globe, each about a tenth, exhibit a singular dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>ference
with regard to political circumstances. One century
ago Russia was but just emerging from a state of barbarism,
and in a century hence, in all human probability, she will
make a conspicuous figure among European nations, both
in arts and arms. Two thousand years ago China was civilized
to the same degree, or nearly so, that she is at present. The
governments were both arbitrary, and the people were slaves.
The natural genius of the Russian, cramped perhaps in some
degree by his frozen climate, is less susceptible of improvement
than that of the Chinese. Whence then, it may be asked, proceeds
the very great difference in the progressive improvement
of the two nations? principally, I should suppose, from the
two following reasons. Russia invites and encourages foreigners
to instruct her subjects in arts, sciences, and manufactures.
China, from a spirit of pride and self-importance, as well as
from jealousy, rejects and expels them. The language of
Russia is easily acquired, and her subjects as easily learn those
of other countries, whilst that of China is so difficult, or their
method of learning it so defective, as to require the study of
half the life of man to fit him for any of the ordinary employments
of the state, and they have no knowledge of any language
but their own. The one is in a state of youthful vigour,
advancing daily in strength and knowledge; the other is worn
out with old age and disease, and under its present state of
existence is not likely to advance in any kind of improvement.</p>

<p>To the principle of universal obedience the Chinese government
has added another, which is well calculated to satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the public mind: the first honours and the highest offices are
open to the very lowest of the people. It admits of no hereditary
nobility; at least none with exclusive privileges. As a
mark of the Sovereign's favour a distinction will sometimes
descend in a family, but, as it confers no power nor privilege
nor emolument, it soon wears out. All dignities may be considered
as merely personal; the princes of the blood, even,
sink gradually into the common mass, unless their talents and
their application be sufficient to qualify them for office, independent
of which there can be neither rank nor honours, and
very little if any distinction, not even in the imperial family,
beyond the third generation. On public days the Emperor,
at a single glance, can distinguish the rank of each of the many
thousand courtiers that are assembled on such occasions by their
dress of ceremony. The civilians have a bird, and the military
a tyger, embroidered on the breast and back of their upper
robe; and their several ranks are pointed out by different
coloured globes, mounted on a pivot on the top of the cap or
bonnet. The Emperor has also two orders of distinction, which
are conferred by him alone, as marks of particular favour; the
order of the yellow vest and of the peacock's feather.</p>

<p>The influence that, in nations of Europe, is derived from
birth, fortune, and character, is of no weight in the Chinese
government. The most learned, and I have already explained
how far the term extends, provided he be not of notorious bad
character, is sure to be employed; though under the present
Tartar government, the Chinese complain that they never arrive
at the highest rank till they are advanced in years. Learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
alone, by the strict maxims of state, leads to office, and office
to distinction. Property, without learning, has little weight, and
confers no distinction, except in some corrupt provincial governments,
where the external marks of office are sold, as in
Canton. Hence property is not so much an object of the laws
in China as elsewhere, and consequently has not the same security.
In the governments of Europe, property seldom fails to
command influence and to force dependence: in China, the
man of property is afraid to own it, and all the enjoyments it
procures him are stolen.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, the highest appointments in the state are
conferred, as it happens elsewhere, by some favourable accident,
or by the caprice of the monarch. A striking instance
of this kind was displayed in the person of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, the
last prime minister of the late <i>Kien-long</i>. This man, a Tartar,
happened to be placed on guard in the palace, where his youth
and comely countenance struck the Emperor so forcibly in passing,
that he sent for him to the presence; and finding him
equally agreeable in his conversation and manners, he raised
him rapidly, but gradually, from the situation of a common
soldier, to the highest station in the empire. Such sudden
changes, from a state of nothingness to the summit of power,
have frequently been observed to be attended with consequences
no less fatal to the man so elevated, than pernicious to the
public: and thus it happened to this favourite minister. During
the life of his old master, over whom, in his later years, he is
said to have possessed an unbounded influence, he availed himself
of the means that offered, by every species of fraud and ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>tortion,
by tyranny and oppression, to amass such immense
wealth in gold, silver, pearls, and immoveable property, that
his acquisitions were generally allowed to have exceeded those
of any single individual, that the history of the country had
made known. His pride and haughty demeanour had rendered
him so obnoxious to the royal family that, at the time we were
in Pekin, it was generally supposed, he had made up his mind to
die with the old Emperor, for which event he had always at hand
a dose of poison, not chusing to stand the severe investigation
which he was well aware the succeeding prince would direct to
be made into his ministerial conduct. It seems, however, when
that event actually happened, the love of life, and the hope of
escaping, prevailed on him to change his purpose and to stand
the hazard of a trial. Of the crimes and enormities laid to his
charge he was found, or rather he was said to have pleaded,
guilty. The vast wealth he had extorted from others was confiscated
to the crown, and he was condemned to suffer an ignominious
death<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>But <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, if guilty of inordinate ambition, or acts
of injustice, is far from being the only instance of such conduct
in men thus raised from humble situations. The officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of government in general, though intended by the constitution
as a kind of barrier between the prince and the people, are the
greatest oppressors of the latter, who have seldom any means of
redress, or of conveying their complaints to the Imperial ear.
There is no middle class of men in China: men whose property
and ideas of independence give them weight in the part
of the country where they reside; and whose influence and interest
are considered as not below the notice of the government.
In fact, there are no other than the governors and the governed.
If a man, by trade, or industry in his profession, has accumulated
riches, he can enjoy them only in private. He dares not,
by having a grander house, or finer clothes, to let his neighbour
perceive that he is richer than himself, lest he should betray
him to the commanding officer of the district, who would find
no difficulty in bringing him within the pale of the sumptuary
laws, and in laying his property under confiscation.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, the extortions that the officers practise
upon the people, as in the case of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, meet the
hand of justice. Other magistrates keep a steady eye upon their
proceedings, and, in proper time, transmit the necessary information
to court. Spies also are detached from court into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
provinces, under the name of inspectors. Jealous of each
other, they let no opportunity slip of making unfavourable reports
to their superiors. Notwithstanding which, with all the
precautions taken by government in favour of the subject, the
latter finds himself most dreadfully oppressed. It is true, for
very slight offences preferred against men in office, the court
directs a public reprimand in the official Gazette; for those of
a more serious nature, degradation from rank; and every officer
so degraded is under the necessity of proclaiming his own
disgrace in all his public orders; not only to put him in mind
of his past conduct, but likewise to shew the people how watchful
the eye of government is over the actions of its servants.
The last stage of public degradation, which amounts to a sentence
of infamy, is an order to superintend the preparation of
the Emperor's tomb, which implies that the person so sentenced
is more fit to be employed among the dead than the living.
<i>Tchang-ta-gin</i>, the late viceroy of Canton, was condemned
to this degrading service<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>The viceroy of a province can remain in that office no longer
than three years, lest he might obtain an undue influence.
No servant of the crown can form a family alliance in the place
where he commands, nor obtain an office of importance in the
city or town wherein he was born. Yet with these, and other
precautions, there is still little security for the subject. He has
no voice whatsoever in the government, either directly or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>representation; and the only satisfaction he possibly can receive
for injuries done to him, and that is merely of a negative kind,
is the degradation or the removal of the man in power, who
had been his oppressor, and who perhaps may be replaced by another
equally bad.</p>

<p>The ingenious Mr. Pauw has observed, that China is entirely
governed by the whip and the bamboo. To these he might
have added the yearly calendar and the Pekin Gazette, both of
which, as engines in the hands of government, contribute very
materially to assist its operations. By the circulation of the first
is kept alive the observance of certain superstitions which it
is, apparently, the study of government to encourage. The
second is a vehicle for conveying into every corner of the empire
the virtues and the fatherly kindness of the reigning sovereign,
shewn by punishing the officers of his government, not
only for what they have done amiss, but for what they may have
omitted to do. Thus, if a famine has desolated any of the provinces,
the principal officers are degraded for not having taken
the proper precautions against it. This paper, in the shape of
a small pamphlet, is published every second day. The missionaries
have pretended that immediate death would be the
consequence of inserting a falsehood in the Imperial Gazette.
Yet it is famous for describing battles that were never
fought, and for announcing victories that were never gained.
The truth of this observation appears from several proclamations
of <i>Kaung-shee</i>, <i>Tchien Long</i>, and the present Emperor,
warning the generals on distant stations from making false re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>ports,
and from killing thousands and ten thousands of the enemy,
sometimes even when no engagement had taken place<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.
The reverend gentlemen only mean to say, that the editor would
be punished if he ventured to insert any thing not sent to him
officially by the government.</p>

<p>The press in China is as free as in England, and the profession
of printing open to every one, which is a singular circumstance,
and perhaps the only instance of the kind, in a despotic
government. It has usually been supposed that, in free countries
only where every person is equally under the protection,
and equally liable to the penalties, of the law, the liberty of the
press could be cherished; and that it was a thing next to impossible,
that power, founded on error and supported by oppression,
could long be maintained where the press was free. It
was the press that in Europe effected the ruin of priestly power,
by dispelling the clouds that had long obscured the rays of
truth; and by opening a free access to the doctrines of that religion
which, of all others, is best calculated for the promotion
of individual happiness and public virtue<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>In China the liberty of the press seems to excite no apprehensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
in the government. The summary mode of punishing
any breach of good morals, without the formality of a trial,
makes a positive prohibition against printing unnecessary, being
itself sufficient to restrain the licentiousness of the press. The
printer, the vender, and the reader of any libellous publication,
are all equally liable to be flogged with the bamboo. Few, I
suppose, would be hardy enough to print reflexions on the conduct
of government, or its principal officers, as such publications
would be attended with certain ruin. Yet, notwithstanding
all the dangers to which the printing profession is liable,
daily papers are published in the capital, circulating, something
like our own, private anecdotes, domestic occurrences, public
notices of sales, and the wonderful virtues of quack medicines.
We were told that, in one of these papers, the Portuguese missionary
mentioned in Mr. Grammont's letter got a paragraph
inserted, purporting the great neglect of the English in having
brought no presents for the princes of the blood, nor for the
Emperor's ministers. This false and malicious paragraph was
said to be followed by another, insinuating that those for the
Emperor were common articles of little value. Another pretended
to give a catalogue of them, and included an elephant
about the size of a rat, giants, dwarfs, wishing pillows, and
such like nonsense. These, however, and other publications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
were industriously kept from our sight. Under the generous
idea of being the Emperor's guests, we were not allowed to
purchase any thing. He alone was to supply our wants, but
his officers took the liberty of judging what these wants should
consist in.</p>

<p>It is a singular phenomenon in the history of nations, how
the government of an empire, of such vast magnitude as that of
China, should have preserved its stability without any material
change, for more than two thousand years; for, dropping their
pretensions to an extravagant antiquity, for which however
they have some grounds, there can be no doubt they were
pretty much in the same state, regulated by the same laws, and
under the same form of government as they now are, four hundred
years before the birth of Christ, about which time their
renowned philosopher flourished, whose works are still held <a name="in" id="in"></a>in
the highest reputation. They contain indeed all the maxims <a name="on" id="on"></a>on
which their government is still grounded, and all the rules by
which the different stations of life take their moral conduct; and
the monarchy is supposed to have been established two thousand
years before his time.</p>

<p>If the test of a good government be made to depend on the
length of its continuance, unshaken and unchanged by revolutions,
China may certainly be allowed to rank the first among
civilized nations. But, whether good or bad, it has possessed
the art of moulding the multitude to its own shape in a manner
unprecedented in the annals of the world. Various accidents,
improved by policy, seem to have led to its durability. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
these the natural barriers of the country, excluding any foreign
enemy, are not to be reckoned as the least favourable; whilst
the extreme caution of the government in admitting strangers
kept the world in ignorance, for many ages, of the existence even
of the most extensive, powerful, and populous empire among
men. Secluded thus from all intercourse with the rest of the
world, it had time and leizure to mould its own subjects into
the shape it wished them to retain; and the event has sufficiently
proved its knowledge in this respect.</p>

<p>A number of fortunate circumstances, seldom combined in
the same country, have contributed to the preservation of internal
tranquillity in China. The language is of a nature well calculated
to keep the mass of the people in a state of ignorance.
They are neither prohibited from embracing any religion of
which they may make a choice, nor coerced to contribute towards
the support of one they do not approve. The pains that
have been taken to inculcate sober habits, to destroy mutual
confidence, and render every man reserved and suspicious of his
neighbour, could not fail to put an end to social intercourse.
No meetings were held, even for convivial purposes, beyond
the family circle, and these only at the festival of new year.
Those kind of turbulent assemblies, where real or imagined
grievances are discussed with all the rancour and violence that
malicious insinuations against government, added to the effects
of intoxicating draughts, too frequently inspire, never happen
among the Chinese. Contented in having no voice in the government,
it has never occurred to them that they have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
rights<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>: and they certainly enjoy none but what are liable to
be invaded and trampled on, whenever the sovereign, or any
of his representatives, from interest, malice, or caprice, think
fit to exercise the power that is within their grasp. The doctrine
of employing resistence against oppression, applied to the
people and the government, is so contrary to every sentiment
of the former, that the latter has little to fear on that score.</p>

<p>Partial insurrections occasionally happen, but they are generally
owing to the extreme poverty of the people which, in
seasons of scarcity and famine, compels them to take by violence
the means of subsisting life, which otherwise they could not
obtain. To this cause may be referred the origin of almost all
the commotions recorded in their history, through some of
which, when the calamity became general, the regular succession
has been interrupted, and even changed. We were told,
however, by our Chinese attendants, that certain mysterious
societies did exist in some of the provinces, whose chief object
was to overturn the Tartar government; that they held secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>meetings, in which they gave vent to their complaints against
Tartar preponderancy, revived the memory of ancient glory,
brooded over present injuries, and meditated revenge. If even
this be the case, the present state of society is little favourable to
their views. Nor indeed would a revolution be a desirable event
for the Chinese themselves. It could not fail of being attended with
the most horrible consequences. The Tartar soldiers would be
tired with slaying, and millions that escaped the sword must
necessarily perish by famine, on the least interruption of
the usual pursuits of agriculture; for they have no other country
to look to for supplies, and they raise no surplus quantity in
their own.</p>

<p>In order to prevent as much as possible a scarcity of grain,
and in conformity to their opinion, that the true source of national
wealth and prosperity consists in agriculture, the Chinese
government has in all ages bestowed the first honours on every
improvement in this branch of industry. The husbandman is
considered as an honourable, as well as useful, member of society;
he ranks next to men of letters, or officers of state, of whom indeed
he is frequently the progenitor. The soldier in China
cultivates the ground. The priests also are agriculturists, whenever
their convents are endowed with land. The Emperor is
considered as the sole proprietary of the soil, but the tenant is
never turned out of possession as long as he continues to pay his
rent, which is calculated at about one-tenth of what his farm
is supposed capable of yielding; and though the holder of lands
can only be considered as a tenant at will, yet it is his own fault
if he should be dispossessed. So accustomed are the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
to consider an estate as their own, while they continue to pay
the rent, that a Portuguese in Macao had nearly lost his life
for endeavouring to raise the rent upon his Chinese tenants. If
any one happens to hold more than his family can conveniently
cultivate, he lets it out to another on condition of receiving half
the produce, out of which he pays the whole of the Emperor's
taxes. A great part of the poorer peasantry cultivate lands on
these terms.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, no immense estates grasping nearly the
whole of a district; no monopolizing farmers, nor dealers in
grain. Every one can bring his produce to a free and open
market. No fisheries are let out to farm. Every subject is
equally entitled to the free and uninterrupted enjoyment of
the sea, of the coasts, and the estuaries; of the lakes and rivers.
There are no manor lords with exclusive privileges; no lands
set apart for feeding beasts or birds for the profit or pleasure of
particular persons; every one may kill game on his own grounds,
and on the public commons. Yet with all these seeming advantages,
there are rarely three successive years without a famine
in one province or another.</p>

<p>As in the Roman Empire examples were not wanting of the
first characters in the state glorying to put their hands to the
plough, to render the earth fertile, and to engage in the natural
employment of man; as,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
In ancient times the sacred plough employ'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">The kings and awful fathers,</span>
</div></div>

<p>So, in China, the Emperor at the vernal equinox, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
a solemn offering to the God of Heaven and Earth, goes
through the ceremony of holding the plough, an example in
which he is followed by the viceroys and governors and great
officers in every part of the empire. This ceremony, though,
in all probability, the remains of a religious institution, is well
calculated to give encouragement to the labouring peasantry,
whose profession, thus honourably patronized, cannot fail to be
pursued with more energy and cheerfulness than where it receives
no such marks of distinction. Here merchants, tradesmen,
and mechanics, are considered far beneath the husbandman.
So far from obtaining the honours attendant on commerce
in the ancient city of Tyre, "whose merchants were
princes, whose traffickers were the honourable of the earth"&mdash;or
the ancient immunities granted in Alfred's reign, by which an
English merchant, who had made three foreign voyages by sea,
was raised to the rank of nobility, the man who, in China, engages
in foreign trade is considered as little better than a vagabond.
The home trade only is supposed to be necessary, and
deserving the protection of government. It allows all goods and
manufactures, the produce of the country, to be interchanged
between the several provinces, on payment only of a small transit
duty to the state, and certain tolls on the canals and rivers, applied
chiefly to the repairs of flood-gates, bridges, and embankments.
This trade, being carried on entirely by barter, employs
such a multitude of craft of one description or other, as to baffle
all attempts at a calculation. I firmly believe, that all the floating
vessels in the world besides, taken collectively, would not be
equal either in number or tonnage to those of China.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Foreign trade is barely tolerated. So very indifferent the
court of Pekin affects to be on this subject, that it has been hinted,
on some occasions, and indeed serious apprehensions have been
entertained in Europe, that they were half disposed to shut the
port of Canton against foreigners. The treatment, indeed, which
strangers meet with at this place, from the inferior officers of
government, is of itself sufficient to exclude them, and such
as could only be tolerated in consideration of the importance
of the trade, and especially in the supply of tea; an article
which, from being about a century ago a luxury, is now become,
particularly in Great Britain, one of the first necessities
of life.</p>

<p>The taxes raised for the support of government are far from
being exorbitant or burthensome to the subject. They consist
in the tenth of the produce of the land paid usually in kind, in a
duty on salt, on foreign imports, and a few smaller taxes, that do
not materially affect the bulk of the people. The total amount of
taxes and assessments which each individual pays to the state,
taken on an average, does not exceed four shillings a year.</p>

<p>With such advantages, unknown in most other countries, and
such great encouragement given to agriculture, one would be led
to suppose that the condition of the poor must be less exposed to
hardships here than elsewhere. Yet in years of scarcity many
thousands perish from absolute want of food. And such years
so frequently occur in one province or another, either from
unfavourable seasons of drought or inundations, the ill effects
of both of which might probably be counteracted by proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
management, or by an honest application of the sums of money
voted for the purpose out of the public revenue, that government
has seldom been able to lay up in store a sufficient quantity
of grain to meet the necessities of the people in seasons of
general calamity; and they have no other relief to depend on
but this precarious supply, seldom administered with alacrity,
on account of the number of hands it has to pass through. This
leads them to commit outrages against their wealthier neighbours.
There are few public charities; and it is not a common
custom to ask alms. I did not observe a single beggar
from one extremity of China to the other, except in the
streets of Canton. Nor are there any poor-laws griping the
industrious husbandman and labourer, to feed the lazy, and
to feast those who have the care of them; no paupers of any
description, supported from funds that have been levied on the
public. The children, if living and, if not, the next of kin,
must take care of their aged relations; and the parents dispose
of their children in what manner they may think best for the
family interest. As several generations live together, they are
subsisted at a much cheaper rate than if each had a separate
household. In cases of real distress the government is supposed
to act the parent; and its good intentions in this respect cannot
be called in question; whenever it appears that any of its officers,
through neglect or malice, have withheld grain from the
poor, they are punished with singular severity, sometimes even
with death.</p>

<p>Another great advantage enjoyed by the Chinese subject is,
that the amount of his taxes is ascertained. He is never re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>quired
to contribute, by any new assessment, to make up a
given sum for the extraordinary expences of the state, except
in cases of rebellion, when an additional tax is sometimes imposed
on the neighbouring provinces. But in general the executive
government must adapt its wants to the ordinary supplies,
instead of calling on the people for extraordinary contributions.
The amount of the revenues of this great empire has been differently
stated. As the principal branch, the land-tax, is paid
in kind, it is indeed scarcely possible to estimate the receipt of
it accurately, as it will greatly depend on the state of the crop.
An Emperor who aims at popularity never fails to remit this
tax or rent, in such districts as have suffered by drought or
inundation. <i>Chou-ta-gin</i> gave to Lord Macartney, from the
Imperial rent-roll, a rough sketch of the sums raised in each
province, making them to amount in the whole to about sixty-six
millions sterling; which is not more than twice the revenue
of the state in Great Britain, exclusive of the poor's-rate and
other parochial taxes, in 1803, and which gives, as I before
observed, if reduced to a capitation, the sum of about four
shillings for each individual, whilst that of Great Britain, by
an analogous computation, would amount to about fifteen times
that sum. I should suppose, however, that a shilling in China,
generally speaking, will go as far as three in Great Britain.</p>

<p>From the produce of the taxes the civil and military establishments,
and all the incidental and extraordinary expences,
are first paid on the spot where they are incurred, out of the provincial
magazines, and the remainder is remitted to the Imperial

establishment of the Emperor, his palaces, temples, gardens,
women, and princes of the blood. The confiscations, presents,
tributes, and other articles, may be reckoned as his privy purse.
The surplus revenue remitted to Pekin, in the year 1792, was
stated to be about 36,000,000 ounces of silver, or 12,000,000<i>l.</i>
sterling. It is a general opinion among the Chinese part of his
subjects, that vast sums of the surplus revenue and such as
arise from confiscations are annually sent to Moukden, the
capital of Mantchoo Tartary; but this should appear to be an
erroneous opinion founded on prejudice. Notwithstanding the
enormous wealth of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, that filled the Imperial
coffers, the present Emperor found it necessary the same year to
accept an offering, as it was called, of 500,000 ounces of silver,
or 166,666<i>l.</i> sterling, from the salt merchants of Canton, and
sums of money and articles of merchandize from other quarters,
to enable him to quell a rebellion that was raging in one of the
western provinces. He even sent down to Canton a quantity
of pearls, agates, serpentines, and other stones of little value, in
the hope of raising a temporary supply from the sale of them
to foreign merchants. The Emperor of China, therefore, has
not so much wealth at his disposal as has usually been imagined.
He even accepts of patriotic gifts from individuals, consisting
of pieces of porcelain, silks, fans, tea, and such-like trifling
articles, which afterwards serve as presents to foreign embassadors,
and each gift is pompously proclaimed in the Pekin
gazette.</p>

<p>The chief officers in the civil departments of government,
independent of the ministers and the different boards in Pekin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
according to the statement of <i>Tchou-ta-gin</i>, with their salaries
and allowances reduced into silver, will be seen from the following
table, which, with that of the military establishment, is
published in the appendix to the authentic account of the embassy
by Sir George Staunton; and as they differ very little from
the court calendar published in 1801, and as I have occasion
to make a few remarks on them, as well as on that of the population,
which will be given in a subsequent chapter, I have not
hesitated to introduce them into the present work.</p>

<p>The inferior officers acting immediately under the orders
of these, and amounting to many thousands, together with
the salaries and expences of the different boards in the capital,
all of which are paid out of the public treasury, must require
a sum at least equal to the above; so that on a moderate
calculation, the ordinary expences of the civil establishment
will amount to the sum of 5,920,000 ounces, or 1,973,333<i>l.</i>
sterling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the numerous appointments,
and the frequent changes in administration, from the circumstance
of the Court Calendar, or red book, being published
every three months making four tolerable large volumes, or
sixteen volumes every year.</p>

<p>The fatherly attention, the wise precautions, and the extreme
jealousy of the government, have not been considered as alone
sufficient for the internal and external protection of the empire,
without the assistance of an immense standing army. This
army, in the midst of a profound peace, was stated by <i>Van-ta-gin</i>
to consist of eighteen hundred thousand men, one million
of which were said to be infantry, and eight hundred thousand
cavalry. As this government, however, is supposed to
be much given to exaggeration in all matters relating to the
aggrandisement of the country, and to deal liberally in hyperboles,
wherever numbers are concerned, the authenticity of
the above statement of their military force may perhaps be
called in question. The sum of money, that would be required
to keep in pay and furnish the extraordinaries of so immense
an army, is so immoderate that the revenues would appear to
be unable to bear it. If the pay and the appointments of each
soldier, infantry and cavalry one with another, be supposed
to amount to a shilling a day, the sum required for the pay
alone would amount to 33,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling a year!</p>

<p>To come nearer the truth, let us take the calculation drawn
up by Lord Macartney from the information of <i>Van-ta-gin</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>And as no allowance is made in the above estimate for the expence
of artillery, tents, war equipage, nor for vessels of force
on the different rivers and canals, the building and keeping in
repair the military posts, the flags, ceremonial dresses, boats,
waggons, musical bands, all of which are included in the extraordinaries
of the army, these may probably be equal to the
ordinaries; thus the whole military establishment would require
the sum of 149,948,900 ounces, or 49,982,933<i>l.</i> sterling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>The disposal of the revenues will then stand as follows:</p>

<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>which accords pretty nearly with the sum said to be remitted
to Pekin in the year 1792.</p>

<p>It will appear then that if the revenues be admitted as accurate,
and I see no just reason for supposing the contrary, they
are more than sufficient to meet the expences of so apparently
an enormous establishment. If, however, the King of Prussia,
the Monarch of a small indistinguishable speck on the globe,
when put in comparison with the empire of China, can keep
up an army of one hundred and eighty or two hundred thousand
men, I can perceive nothing either extravagant or extraordinary
in supposing that a Sovereign whose dominions are
eight times the extent of those of France, before her late
usurpations, should have ten times as great a force as that of
the King of Prussia. It may perhaps be asked in what manner
are they employed, seeing the nation is so little engaged in
foreign war? The employments for which the military are
used differ materially from those among European nations.
Except a great part of the Tartar cavalry, who are stationed on
the northern frontier and in the conquered provinces of Tartary,
and the Tartar infantry, who are distributed as guards
for the different cities of the empire, the rest of the army is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
parcelled out in the smaller towns, villages, and hamlets; where
they act as jailors, constables, thief-takers, assistants to magistrates,
subordinate collectors of the taxes, guards to the granaries;
and are employed in a variety of different ways under
the civil magistracy and police. Besides these, an immense
multitude are stationed as guards at the military posts along
the public roads, canals, and rivers. These posts are small
square buildings, like so many little castles, each having on its
summit a watch-tower and a flag; and they are placed at the
distance of three or four miles asunder. At one of these posts
there are never fewer than six men. They not only prevent
robberies and disputes on the roads and canals, but convey the
public dispatches to and from the capital. An express sent
from post to post travels between the capital and Canton in
twelve days, which is upwards of one hundred miles a day.
There is no other post nor mode of conveying letters for the
convenience of the public.</p>

<p>A great part then of the Chinese army can only be considered
as a kind of militia, which never has been, and in all human
probability never will be, embodied, as a part of the community
not living entirely on the labour of the rest, but contributing
something to the common stock. Every soldier stationed
on the different guards has his portion of land assigned to him,
which he cultivates for his family, and pays his quota of the
produce to the state. Such a provision, encouraged by public
opinion, induces the soldier to marry, and the married men are
never removed from their stations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>It will not be expected that men thus circumstanced should
exhibit a very military appearance under arms. In some places,
where they were drawn out in compliment to the Embassador,
when the weather happened to be a little warm, they were
employed in the exercise of their fans, instead of their matchlocks;
others we found drawn up in a single line, and resting
very composedly on their knees to receive the Embassador, in
which posture they remained till their commanding officer
passed the word to rise. Whenever we happened to take them
by surprize, there was the greatest scramble to get their holyday
dresses out of the guard-house, which, when put on, had more
the appearance of being intended for the stage than the field
of battle. Their quilted petticoats, sattin boots, and their fans,
had a mixture of clumsiness and effeminacy that ill accorded
with the military character.</p>

<p>The different kinds of troops that compose the Chinese army
consist of</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="font-size: 100%; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
<p>Tartar cavalry, whose only weapon is the sabre; and a few
who carry bows.</p>

<p>Tartar infantry, bowmen; having also large sabres.</p>

<p>Chinese infantry, carrying the same weapons.</p>

<p>Chinese matchlocks.</p>

<p>Chinese Tygers of war, bearing large round shields of basket-work,
and long ill-made swords. On the shields of the last are
painted monstrous faces of some imaginary animal, intended to
frighten the enemy, or, like another gorgon, to petrify their
beholders.</p></div>

<p>The military dress varies in almost every province. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
they wore blue jackets edged with red, or brown with
yellow; some had long pantaloons; some breeches, with
stockings of cotton cloth; others petticoats and boots. The
bowmen had long loose gowns of blue cotton, stuffed with a
kind of felt or wadding, studded all over with brass knobs,
and bound round the middle with a girdle, from which the
sabre was appended behind, hanging with the point forwards,
and on the right, not the left, side as in Europe. On the head
they wore a helmet of leather, or gilt pasteboard, with flaps on
each side that covered the cheeks and fell upon the shoulder.
The upper part was exactly like an inverted funnel, with a long
pipe terminating in a kind of spear, on which was bound a
tuft of long hair dyed of a scarlet colour.</p>

<p>The greatest number we saw at any one place might be from
two to three thousand, which were drawn up in a single line
along the bank of a river; and as they stood with an interval
between each equal to the width of a man, they formed a very
considerable line in length. Every fifth man had a small triangular
flag, and every tenth a large one; the staffs that supported
them were fixed to the jacket behind the shoulders. Some of
the flags were green, edged with red; others blue, edged with
yellow. I never saw the Chinese troops drawn out in any
other way than a single line in front; not even two deep.</p>

<p>The Tartar cavalry appear to be remarkably swift, and to
charge with great impetuosity; but the horses are so small and
are broken into so quick and short a stroke that the eye is
deceived. Their real speed, in fact, is very moderate. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
saddles are remarkably soft, and raised so high both before and
behind, that the rider cannot easily be thrown out of his seat.
The stirrups are so short that the knee is almost as high as the
chin. They have very little artillery, and that little is as
wretched as it well can be. I suspect it is borrowed from
the Portugueze, as the matchlock most unquestionably has
been.</p>

<p>When our fellow-traveller <i>Van-ta-gin</i> was asked the reason of
their pretending to give a preference to the clumsy matchlocks
over the firelocks now in use among European troops, he
replied, it had been found, after a severe engagement in Thibet,
that the matchlocks had done much more execution
than the firelocks. It is difficult to combat prejudices; but it
was not very difficult to convince <i>Van</i> that the <i>men</i> might probably
have been quite as much in fault as the <i>musquets</i>, and
that the superior steadiness of the fire from the matchlocks
might possibly be owing to their being fixed, by an iron fork,
into the ground. The missionaries have assigned a very absurd
reason for firelocks not being used in China; they say the dampness
of the air is apt to make the flint miss fire. With equal
propriety might these gentlemen have asserted that flints would
not emit fire in Italy. Their want of good iron and steel to
manufacture locks, or the bad quality of their gunpowder, might
perhaps be offered as better reasons; and as the best of all their
want of courage and coolness to make use of them with that
steadiness which is required to produce the effects of which
they are capable. Their favourite instrument is the bow,
which, like all other missile weapons, requires less courage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
manage, than those which bring man to oppose himself in
close contest with man.</p>

<p>Although the Tartars have found it expedient to continue
the Chinese army on the old footing, it may naturally be supposed
they would endeavour to secure themselves by all possible
means in the possession of this vast empire, and that they would
use every exertion to recruit the army with their own countrymen,
in preference to the Chinese. Every Tartar male
child is accordingly enrolled. This precaution was necessary,
as their whole army, at the time of the conquest, is said not to
have exceeded eighty thousand men. At this time, in fact, a
weak administration had suffered the empire to be torn asunder
by convulsions. Every department, both civil and military,
was under the control of eunuchs. Six thousand of these creatures
are said to have been turned adrift by the Tartars on
taking possession of the palace in Pekin.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Mantchoo Tartars, whose race is now
on the throne, was a master-piece of policy little to be expected
in a tribe of people that had been considered but as half
civilized. They entered the Chinese dominions as auxiliaries
against two rebel chiefs, but soon perceived they might become
the principals. Having placed their leader on the vacant
throne, instead of setting up for conquerors, they melted at
once into the mass of the conquered. They adopted the dress,
the manners, and the opinions of the people. In all the civil
departments of the state they appointed the ablest Chinese,
and all vacancies were filled with Chinese in preference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Tartars. They learned the Chinese language; married into
Chinese families; encouraged Chinese superstitions; and, in
short, omitted no step that could tend to incorporate them
as one nation. Their great object was to strengthen the army
with their own countrymen, whilst the Chinese were so satisfied
with the change, that they almost doubted whether a change
had really taken place.</p>

<p>The uninterrupted succession of four Emperors, all of whom
were endowed with excellent understandings, uncommon vigour
of mind, and decision of character, has hitherto obviated the
danger of such an enormous disproportion between the governors
and the governed. The wisdom, prudence, and energy
of these Emperors have not only maintained the family on
the throne, the fifth of which now fills it, but have enlarged
the dominions to an extent of which history furnishes no parallel.
The present Emperor, <i>Kia-king</i>, is said to possess the
learning and prudence of his father, and the firmness of <i>Kaung-shee</i>;
but it is probable he will have a more difficult task in
governing the empire than either of his predecessors. In proportion
as the Tartar power has increased, they have become
less felicitous to conciliate the Chinese. All the heads of departments
are now Tartars. The ministers are all Tartars; and
most of the offices of high trust and power are filled by Tartars.
And although the ancient language of the country is still preserved
as the court language, yet it is more than probable that
Tartar pride, encreasing with its growing power, will ere long
be induced to adopt its own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor <i>Kaung-shee</i> indeed took uncommon pains to
improve the Mantchoo language, and to form it into a systematic
<i>Thesaurus</i> or dictionary; and <i>Tchien-Lung</i> directed that the
children of all such parents as were one a Tartar, the other a
Chinese, should be taught the Mantchoo language; and that
they might pass their examinations for office in that language.
I could observe, that the young men of the royal family at
<i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> spoke with great contempt of the Chinese. One
of them, perceiving that I was desirous of acquiring some
knowledge of the Chinese written character, took great pains
to convince me that the Tartar language was much superior to
it; and he not only offered to furnish me with the alphabet
and some books, but with his instructions also, if I would give
up the Chinese, which, he observed, was not to be acquired in
the course of a man's whole life. I could not forbear remarking,
how very much these young princes enjoyed a jest levelled
against the Chinese. An ill-natured remark, for instance, on
the cramped feet and the hobbling gait of a Chinese woman
met with their hearty approbation; but they were equally displeased
on hearing the clumsy shoes worn by the Tartar
ladies compared to the broad flat-bottomed junks of the
Chinese.</p>

<p>Although the ancient institutes and laws, the established forms
of office, the pageantry of administration, were all retained,
and the dress, the manners, and external deportment of the
vanquished were assumed by the victors, yet the native character
remained distinct; and now, in the higher departments of
office especially, it bursts through all disguise. The conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
superiority of the one checks and overawes the other. "Most
of our books," observes Lord Macartney, "confound the
two people together, and talk of them as if they made only
one nation under the general name of China; but whatever
might be concluded from any outward appearances, the real
distinction is never forgotten by the sovereign who, though
he pretends to be perfectly impartial, conducts himself at
bottom by a systematic nationality, and never for a moment
loses sight of the cradle of his power. The science of government
in the <i>Eastern</i> world, is understood by those who
govern very differently from what it is in the <i>Western</i>.
When the succession of a contested kingdom in Europe is
once ascertained, whether by violence or compromise, the
nation returns to its pristine regularity and composure: it
matters little whether a Bourbon or an Austrian fills
the throne of Naples or of Spain, because the sovereign,
whoever he be, then becomes to all intents and purposes, a
Spaniard or Neapolitan, and his descendants continue so
with accelerated velocity. George the First and George the
Second ceased to be foreigners from the moment our sceptre
was fixed in their hands; and His present Majesty is as
much an Englishman as King Alfred or King Edgar, and governs
his people not by Teutonic, but by English laws.</p>

<p>"The policy of Asia is totally opposite. There the prince
regards the place of his nativity as an accident of mere indifference.
If the parent root be good, he thinks it will flourish
in every soil, and perhaps acquire fresh vigour from transplantation.
It is not locality, but his own cast and family;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
it is not the country where he drew his breath, but the <a name="stock" id="stock"></a>stock
from which he sprung; it is not the scenery of the theatre,
but the spirit of the drama, that engages his attention and
occupies his thoughts. A series of two hundred years, in the
succession of eight or ten monarchs, did not change the Mogul
into a Hindoo, nor has a century and a half made <i>Tchien-Lung</i>
a Chinese. He remains, at this hour, in all his
maxims of policy, as true a Tartar as any of his ancestors."</p>

<p>Whether this most ancient empire among men will long
continue in its stability and integrity, can only be matter of conjecture,
but certain it is, the Chinese are greatly dissatisfied, and
not without reason, at the imperious tone now openly assumed
by the Tartars; and though they are obliged to cringe and submit,
in order to rise to any distinction in the state, yet they unanimously
load them with</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">

"Curses, not loud, but deep, mouth-honour, breath<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Whenever the dismemberment or dislocation of this great machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
shall take place, either by a rebellion or revolution, it
must be at the expence of many millions of lives. For, as is
well observed by Lord Macartney, "A sudden transition from
slavery to freedom, from dependence to authority, can seldom
be borne with moderation or discretion. Every change
in the state of man ought to be gentle and gradual, otherwise
it is commonly dangerous to himself, and intolerable to
others. A due preparation may be as necessary for liberty,
as for inoculation of the small-pox, which, like liberty, is
future health but, without due preparation, is almost certain
destruction. Thus then the Chinese, if not led to emancipation
by degrees, but let loose on a burst of enthusiasm,
would probably fall into all the excesses of folly, suffer all
the paroxysms of madness, and be found as unfit for
the enjoyment of rational freedom, as the French and the

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> suspicious and watchful conduct of the Chinese government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
towards strangers was ill suited to the free and independent
spirit of Britons. Confined within the limits of their
hotel, the populous capital of China was to them little better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
than a desert. It was, therefore, less painful to be obliged to
quit a place which they could consider in no other light than as
an honourable prison, and to take leave of a people, whose general
character seemed to be strongly marked with pride, meanness,
and ignorance. After having passed some time in a nation,
where every petty officer is a tyrant, and every man a slave,
how doubly precious do the blessings of that true liberty appear,
which our happy constitution affords to every one the means
of enjoying at home; where property is secured from violence,
and where the life of the meanest subject is equally protected
with that of the prince. Let those visionary men, who amuse
themselves in building Utopian governments, and those who,
from real or fancied injury or neglect, feel the chagrin of disappointment,
visit other countries, and experience how justice
is administered in other nations; they will then be taught to
confess that real liberty exists only in Great Britain&mdash;in that
happy island where, to use the expression of an eminent writer
on the laws of nations<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, "an enlightened piety in the
people is the firmest support of lawful authority; and in the
sovereign's breast, it is the pledge of the people's safety, and
excites their confidence."</p>

<p>Impressed with such sentiments, on the evening of the 7th
of October I rode through the streets of Pekin, for the last time,
in company with Mr. Maxwell. We were quite alone, not a
single Chinese servant, nor soldier, nor officer to conduct us;
yet we had no difficulty in finding our way. We passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>through the broad streets of this capital from one extremity to
the other without the least molestation, or, indeed, the least notice.
We could not forbear remarking the extraordinary contrast,
that the two greatest cities in the world exhibited at this
hour of the day. In the public streets of Pekin, after five or
six o'clock in the evening, scarcely a human creature is seen to
move, but they abound with dogs and swine. All its inhabitants,
having finished the business of the day, are now retired to their
respective homes to eat their rice and, agreeably with the custom
of their great Emperor, which to them is a law, to lie
down with the setting sun; at which time in London, the crowd
is so great, from Hyde Park corner to Mile End, as to interrupt
each other. In Pekin, from the moment the day begins
to dawn, the buzz and the bustle of the populace is like that
of a swarm of bees; whilst, on the contrary, the streets of London
at an early hour in the morning are nearly deserted. At
eight in the evening, even in summer, the gates of Pekin are
shut, and the keys sent to the governor, after which they cannot
be opened on any consideration.</p>

<p>The Embassador and the rest of the suite, with the soldiers,
servants and musicians had, several hours before us, set out in a
sort of procession, in which an officer of government on horseback
took the lead, with the letter of the Emperor of China to
the King of England slung across his shoulders, in a wooden
case covered with yellow silk. At a late hour in the night, we
joined the rest of the party in the suburbs of <i>Tong-tchoo-foo</i>, where
we were once more lodged among the gods of the nation, in a
temple that was consecrated to the patronizing deity of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
There are no inns in any part of this vast empire; or, to speak
more correctly (for there are resting-places), no inhabited and
furnished houses where, in consideration of paying a certain
sum of money, a traveller may purchase the refreshments of
comfortable rest, and of allaying the calls of hunger. The
state of society admits of no such accommodation, and much
less such as, in many countries, proceeds from a spirit of disinterested
hospitality; on the contrary, in this country, they invariably
shut their doors against a stranger. What they call
inns are mean hovels, consisting of bare walls where, perhaps,
a traveller may procure his cup of tea for a piece of copper
money, and permission to pass the night; but this is the extent
of the comforts which such places hold out. The practice indeed
of travelling by land is so rare, except occasionally in those
parts of the country which admit not the convenience of inland
navigations, or at such times when these are frozen up, that the
profits which might arise from the entertainment of passengers
could not support a house of decent accommodation. The officers
of state invariably make life of the conveniences which
the temples offer, as being superior to any other which the
country affords; and the priests, well knowing how vain it
would be to resist, or remonstrate, patiently submit, and resign
the temporary use of their apartments without a murmur.</p>

<p>In most countries of the civilized world, the buildings appropriated
for religious worship and the repositories of their gods,
are generally held sacred. In the monasteries of those parts of
Europe, where inns are not to be found, the apartments of the
monks are sometimes resorted to by travellers, but in China the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
very <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> is invaded. Every corner is indiscriminately
occupied by men in power, if they should require it.
Sometimes, also, the whole building is made a common place of
resort for vagrants and idlers, where gamblers mix with gods,
and priests with pick-pockets. In justice, however, it must be
observed, that the priests of the two popular religions which
predominate in the country shew no inclination to encourage,
by joining in, the vicious practices of the rabble; but having
no pay nor emolument from government, and being rather
tolerated than supported, they are obliged to submit to and
to overlook abuses of this nature, and even to allow the profane
practices of the rabble in the very hours of their devotion. Yet
there is a decency of behaviour, a sort of pride and dignity in
the deportment of a Chinese priest, that readily distinguish
him from the vulgar. The calumnies, which some of the
Roman Catholic missionaries have so industriously circulated
against them, seem to have no foundation in truth. The near
resemblance of their dress and holy rites to those of their own
faith was so mortifying a circumstance, that none of the missionaries
I conversed with could speak with temper of the priests
of China. I could not even prevail on our interpreter of the
<i>propaganda fide</i>, who still manifested a predilection for the customs
of his country in every other respect, to step into the temple
where the altar was placed; nor could he be induced, by any
persuasion, to give or to ask an explanation of their mysterious
doctrines.</p>

<p>There is no subject, perhaps, on which a traveller ought to
speak with less confidence, than on the religious opinions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the people he may chance to visit, in countries out of Europe,
especially when those opinions are grounded on a very
remote antiquity. The allegorical allusions in which they
might originally have been involved, the various changes they
may since have undergone, the ceremonies and types under
which they are still exhibited, in their modern dress, render
them so wholly unintelligible that, although they may have
been founded in truth and reason, they now appear absurd and
ridiculous; equally inexplicable by the people themselves who
profess them, as by those who are utter strangers. The various
modes, indeed, under which the Creator and Ruler of the Universe
is recognised by various nations, all tending to one point,
but setting out in very different directions, can only be understood
and reconciled by a thorough knowledge of the language,
the history, and the habits of the people; of their origin and
connections with other nations; and, even after such knowledge
has been obtained, it is no easy task to separate fable from
metaphor, and truth from fiction. For these reasons, the religion
of China appears to be fully as obscure and inexplicable
as that of almost any other of the oriental nations. The language
of the country, added to the jealousy of the government
in admitting foreigners, have thrown almost insuperable obstacles
in the way of clearing up this intricate subject; and those
few, who only have had opportunities of overcoming these difficulties,
were unfortunately men of that class, whose opinions
were so warped by the prejudices imbibed with the tenets of
their own religion, that the accounts given by them are not always
to be depended upon. As I have already observed, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
cannot bring themselves to speak or to write of the priests of
China with any degree of temper or moderation.</p>

<p>It would be presumptuous in me to suppose, for a moment,
that I am qualified to remove the veil of darkness that covers
the popular religion of China. But as, in the practice of this
religion, it is impossible not to discover a common origin with
the systems of other nations in ancient times, it may not be
improper to introduce a few remarks on the subject, and to
enquire if history will enable us to point out, in what manner
they might have received or communicated the superstitions
and metaphysical ideas that seem to prevail among them. The
obvious coincidence between some parts of the mythological
doctrines of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, with those of
China, induced the learned Monsieur de Guignes and many
of the Jesuits to infer, that a colony from Egypt, at some remote
period, had passed into China. This however does not
appear probable. The Chinese are not a mixed but a distinct
race of men; and their countenance has nothing of the ancient
Egyptian in it. Nor indeed is it necessary to suppose any such
connection, in order to explain the vestiges of Egyptian mythology
that may appear in their temples. We are informed
by history that when Alexander marched into India, about three
centuries before the birth of Christ, many learned Greeks accompanied
him on this memorable expedition; and we are
further informed that, two centuries after this period when
the persecutions and cruelties of Ptolemy Physcon expelled
great numbers of learned and pious Greeks and Egyptians
from the city of Alexandria, they travelled eastward in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of an asylum among the Persians and the Indians; so that there
is nothing extraordinary in meeting with Greek and Egyptian
superstitions among nations of the East; even where no vestige
of their language remains. For it may be observed that,
whenever colonies emigrate from their own country and
settle among strangers, they are much more apt to lose their
native language, than their religious dogmas and superstitious
notions. Necessity indeed may compel them to adopt the language
of the new country into which they have emigrated, but
any compulsive measures to draw them to another religion serve
only to strengthen them in their own. The French refugees
at the Cape of Good Hope totally lost their language in less
than seventy years; and, singular as it may appear, I met with a
deserter from one of the Scotch regiments, on the borders of the
Kaffer country, who had so far forgot his language, in the
course of about three years, that he was not able to make himself
intelligible by it. Many languages, we know, have totally
been lost, and others so changed as scarcely to preserve any
traces of their original form<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Bailly, with some other learned and ingenious men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
was of opinion, that many fragments of the old and absurd
fables of China are discoverable in the ancient history of the
Hindus, from the birth of <i>Fo-shee</i>, the founder of the empire
(<i>Fo-hi</i>, as the French write the word,) until the introduction
of Budha, or Fo. Like the Hindus, it is true, they have
always shewn a remarkable predilection for the number <i>nine</i>.
Confucius calls it the most perfect of numbers. But the Scythians,
or Tartars, have also considered this as a sacred number.
It is true, likewise, they resemble some of the Indian
nations, in the observance of solstitial and equinoxial sacrifices;
in making offerings to the manes of their ancestors; in the
dread of leaving no offspring behind them, to pay the customary
obsequies to their memory; in observing eight cardinal
or principal points of the world; in the division of the Zodiac,
and in a variety of other coincidences, which the learned Mr.
Bryant accounts for by supposing the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans,
and Indians, to be derived from one common stock, and
that some of these people carried their religion and their learning
into China. No proof however is adduced, either by him
or others, of such a communication; and an assertion directly
the contrary might have been made with equal plausibility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Chinese do not owe their origin to the same stock,
their physical character is of itself a sufficient proof. The small
eye, rounded at the extremity next the nose, instead of being
angular, as is the case in that of Europeans, its oblique instead
of horizontal position, and the flat and broad root of the nose,
are features or characters entirely distinct from the Hindu, the
Greek, or the Roman; and belong more properly to the natives
of that vast extent of country, which was known to the ancients
by the name of Scythia, and, in modern times, by that of
Tartary. There is scarcely in nature two of the human species
that differ more widely than a Chinese and a Hindu, setting
aside the difference of colour, which however modern enquiries
have determined to have little or no relation to climate, but
rather to some original formation of the different species. The
Mantchoo, and indeed all the other Tartar tribes bordering
upon China, are scarcely distinguishable from the Chinese.
The same colour, except in a few instances as I have elsewhere
observed, the same eyes, and general turn of the countenance
prevail, on the continent of Asia, from the tropic of Cancer to
the Frozen Ocean<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. The peninsula of Malacca, and the vast
multitude of islands spread over the eastern seas, and inhabited
by the Malays, as well as those of Japan and Lieou-kieou,
have clearly been peopled from the same common stock. The
first race of people to the northward of Hindostan, that possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>the Tartar countenance, so different from that of the Hindus,
are the inhabitants of Bootan. "The <i>Booteeas</i>," says Captain
Turner, "have invariably black hair, which it is their fashion
to cut short to the head. The eye is a very remarkable
feature of the face; small, black, with long pointed corners<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>,
as though stretched and extended by artificial means.
Their eye-lashes are so thin as to be scarcely perceptible, and
the eye-brow is but slightly shaded. Below the eyes is the
broadest part of the face, which is rather flat, and narrows
from the cheek-bones to the chin; a character of countenance
appearing first to take its rise among the Tartar tribes, but
is by far more strongly marked in the Chinese."</p>

<p>The heights of Tartary, bulging out beyond the general surface
of the globe, have been considered, indeed, by many as
the cradle of the human species, or still more emphatically, and
perhaps more properly, as <i>the foundery of the human race</i>. This
opinion did not arise solely from the vast multitudes of people
corresponding with the Tartar character, that are spread over
every part of the eastern world, and who in countless swarms
once overran all Europe, but was grounded on a supposition,
that the whole surface of the globe, or the greater part of it,
has at one time been submerged in water, and that Tartary was
the last to be covered, and the first that was uncovered; and the
place from whence, of course, a new set of creatures were forged
as in a workshop, from some remnant of the old stock, to be the
germs of future nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p><p>Almost every part of the earth, indeed, affords the most unequivocal
indications that such has actually been the case, not
only in the several marine productions that have been discovered
in high mountains, at a distance from any sea, and
equally deep under the surface of the earth; but more especially
in the formation of the mountains themselves, the very highest
of which, except those of granite, consisting frequently of tabular
masses piled on each other in such regular and horizontal
strata, that their shape and appearance cannot be otherwise
accounted for, or explained by any known principle in nature,
except by supposing them at one time to have existed in a state
of fluidity, by the agency of fire or of water, a point which seems
to be not quite decided between the Volcanists and the Neptunists.
The heights of Tartary are unquestionably the highest
land in the <i>old</i> world. In America they may, perhaps, be exceeded.
<i>Gerbillon</i>, who was a tolerable good mathematician
and furnished with instruments, assures us, that the mountain
<i>Pe-tcha</i>, very inferior to many in Tartary, is nine Chinese <i>lees</i>,
or about fifteen thousand feet, above the level of the plains of
China. This mountain, as well as all the others in the same
country, is composed of sand stone, and rests upon plains of
sand, mixed with rock salt and saltpetre. The <i>Sha-moo</i>, or immense
desert of sand, which stretches along the north-west frontier
of China and divides it from western Tartary, is not less
elevated than the <i>Pe-tcha</i>, and is said to resemble the bed of the
ocean. Some of the mountains starting out of this <i>sea of sand</i>,
which its name implies, cannot be less than twenty thousand
feet above the level of the eastern ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>The formation of the earth affords a wide field for speculation;
and, accordingly, many ingenious theories have been conceived
to explain the various appearances which its surface exhibits.
The best modern naturalists seem, however, to agree,
that water has been one of the principal agents to produce these
effects. The great Linnæus, whose penetrating mind pervaded
the whole empire of nature, after many and laborious enquiries,
acquiesced in the truth of the sacred writings, that the whole
globe of the earth was, at some period of time, submerged in water,
and covered with the vast ocean, until in the lapse
of time one little island appeared in this immense sea,
which island must have been of course the highest mountain
upon the surface of the earth. In support of his hypothesis,
he adduces a number of facts, many of which have fallen
within his own observation, of the progressive retreat of the
sea, the diminution of springs and rivers, and the necessary increment
of land. Among the most remarkable of these are
the observations made by the inhabitants of Northern Bothnia
upon the rocks on the sea coast, from whence it appeared that,
in the course of a century, the sea had subsided more than four
feet; so that six thousand years ago, supposing the rate of retiring
to have been the same, the sea was higher than at present
by two hundred and forty feet. Such great and sensible depression
of the water of the sea must, however, have been only local,
otherwise, as I have elsewhere observed, the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean would have joined within the period of history.
The sea, it is true, in some parts of the world, gains upon the
land, and in others the land upon the sea, but these effects arise
from a different cause to that which is supposed to produce a ge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>neral
retreat. It is true, also, that in the neighbourhood of
mountains and great rivers, very material changes have taken
place in the course of a few ages. The fragments of the
former, worn away by the alternate action of the sun and rains,
are borne down by the torrents of the latter, and deposited in
the eddies formed by the two banks of the rivers where they
join the sea, producing thus alluvious land as, for example, the
Delta of Egypt, which has gradually been deposited out of the
soil of Abyssinia and Upper Egypt; the plains of the northern
parts of China, which have been formed out of the mountains
of Tartary; and those of India from the Thebetian mountains,
and the other high lands to the northward and westward of the
peninsula. As, however, a much greater proportion of the fragments
borne down by rivers must be deposited in the bosom
of the deep than on its shores, the sea by this constant and effective
operation ought rather to advance than to retreat. We may
therefore, perhaps, conclude that, whatever the changes may
have been which the surface of the earth has undergone, with
regard to the proportion and the portion of land and water, the
appearances we now behold in various parts of the globe can
only be explained by supposing some temporary and preternatural
cause, or else by assuming an incalculable period of time
for their production.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression to the more immediate subject
of the present section. It is sufficiently remarkable, and
no inconsiderable proof of the truth of the Sacred Writings,
that almost every nation has some traditionary account of a deluge,
some making it universal, and others local: presuming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
however, the former to be correct, which is not only justified
by the testimony of the author of the Pentateuch, but by natural
appearances, it might perhaps be shewn, with no great
deviation from the generally received opinion, that, instead of
Persia being the hive in which was preserved a remnant of the
ancient world for the continuation of the species, those who
have supposed Tartary to be the cradle, from whence the present
race of men issued, have adopted the more plausible conjecture.
If it be borne in mind that, in every part of the Bible history,
the expressions are accommodated to the understandings of those
for whom they were intended, rather than strictly conformable
to facts, and more consonant to appearances than realities, it
may be supposed, without any offence to the most rigid believer,
that by the mount Ararat was not strictly meant the
identical mountain of that name, which has been recognised in
Armenia, but rather the highest mountain on the face of the
globe; for, if this were not the case, the Mosaic account would
be contradictory in itself, as we are told that, "all the high
hills that were under the whole Heaven were covered." This
concession being allowed, we may suppose that the ark, instead
of resting in Armenia, first struck ground in that part of Tartary
which is now inhabited by the Eleuths, as being the most
elevated tract of country in the old world. From these heights
large rivers flow towards every quarter of the horizon. It is
here that the sources of the Selenga are found, descending to the
northward into the lake Baikal, and from thence by the Enesei
and the Lena into the Frozen Ocean: of the Amour, which
empties its waters to the eastward into the gulph of Tartary:
of the two great rivers of China flowing to the southward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
of numberless lakes and rivers discharging their waters to the
westward, some burying themselves in deserts of sand, and
others working their way to the great lake of Aral and the Caspian
sea.</p>

<p>From such a situation, admitting the earth to have been peopled
in succession, the two great rivers which took the southerly direction
and crossed the fertile and extensive plains of China,
were fully as likely to direct the few survivors of the deluge to
this country, as that they should follow any of the other streams;
and probably more so, as these led to a warmer and more comfortable
climate, where fewer wants were felt and those few
more easily supplied. Considered in this point of view, the opinion
of the Jesuits will not appear so ill founded, which supposes
that Noah, separating from his rebellious family, travelled
with a part of his offspring into the east, and founded the Chinese
monarchy; and that he is the same person as the <i>Foo-shee</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of
their history. The words of scripture <i>from the east</i>, an ingenious
commentator has observed, ought more properly to be
translated, <i>at the beginning</i>. At all events, the fact I conclude
to be irresistible, that the Tartars and the Chinese have one common
origin, and the question then is simply this, whether the
fertile plains of China were abandoned for the bleak and barren
heights of Tartary, or that the wandering and half-famished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>Scythians descended into regions whose temperature and productions
were more congenial to the nature of man.</p>

<p>If, however, we allow China to have been among the first
nations formed after the flood, it does not appear to have kept
pace in learning and in arts with the Chaldeans, the Assyrians,
or the Egyptians. Before the time of Confucius, its progress
in civilization seems to have been very slow. He was the first
person who digested any thing like a history of the kings of
Loo; for, in his time, the country was divided among a number
of petty princes, who lived at the head of their families,
much in the same manner as formerly the chiefs of the clans in
the Highlands of Scotland; or, perhaps, more properly speaking,
like the German princes, whose petty states are so many
parts of one great empire. It is now about two thousand years
since the several monarchies were consolidated in one undivided
and absolute empire. There are several reasons for supposing
that, before this period, China made no great figure among the
polished nations of the world, although it produced a Confucius,
some of whose works demonstrate a vigorous and an enlightened
mind. From the commentaries of this philosopher on one of
their classical books<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, it would appear that a regular succession of
Emperors could be traced near two thousand years back from
his time, or more than four thousand years from the present
period. The duration of the dynasties, with their several Emperors,
which he enumerates, and the detail of occurrences
in each reign, make the truth of the history sufficiently plausible,
though the chronology, from their total ignorance of astro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>nomy,
must necessarily be defective. It is still an extraordinary
circumstance, that none of the ancient classical authors
should have had the least knowledge of such a nation. Homer
neither mentions them nor makes any allusion to such a people;
and Herodotus seems to have been equally ignorant of their
existence; and yet, according to the best chronologists, Herodotus
and Confucius must have been contemporaries. It may
fairly be concluded then, that the early Greeks had no knowledge
of the Chinese. Even more than a century after the father
of history flourished, when the Persian empire was overthrown
by Alexander, it does not appear that the Chinese were known
to this nation; which in all probability would have been the
case, notwithstanding their aversion to any intercourse with foreigners,
had they constituted, at that time, a large and powerful
empire; perhaps, indeed, the ignorance of the Persians might
arise from the intervention of the civilized nations of India, whose
numbers might have made it prudent in the former to direct
their arms constantly towards the west rather than to the east.</p>

<p>It has been an opinion pretty generally adopted, that the
people known to the ancients by the name of <i>Seres</i> were the
same as the Chinese, partly on account of their eastern situation,
and partly because the principal silk manufactures were supposed
to be brought from thence, which gave the Romans occasion
name the country <i>Sericum</i>. The Romans, however,
received the trifling quantity of silk made use of by them from
Persia, and not from China, nor from the country of the Seres.
Nor is it probable, that the latter should be the Chinese, who
are said to have sent an embassy to Augustus, in order to court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the friendship of the Romans, it being so very contrary to their
fundamental laws, which not only prohibit any intercourse
with strangers, but allow not any of the natives to leave the
country. The fact, indeed, of this embassy rests solely upon
the authority of Lucius A. Florus, who wrote his history, if it
may so be called, nearly a century after the death of Augustus:
and, as none of the historians contemporary with that Emperor,
take any notice of such an event, it is more than probable
that no such embassy was sent to Rome<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>The first people that we know to have travelled into China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
was a colony of Jews who, according to the records kept by
their descendants, and which I understood from some of the
missionaries are corroborated as to the time by Chinese history,
first settled there shortly after the expedition of Alexander had
opened a communication with India. Nor is it at all improbable
that this adventurous and industrious people were the first
to carry with them, into their new country, the silk worm and
the mode of rearing it, either from Persia, or some of the neighbouring
countries. The Emperor <i>Kaung-shee</i>, in his observations on
natural history, takes notice that the Chinese are greatly mistaken
when they say that silk was an exclusive product of China, for
that the upper regions of India have a native worm of a larger
growth, and which spins a stronger silk than any in China.
Although indeed ancient authors are silent as to the article of silk,
there are grounds for supposing it was not unknown in Tangut
and Kitai. Several expressions in the Bible warrant the opinion
that silk was used in the time of Solomon, and the <i>vestes
perlucidæ ac fluidæ Medis</i> of Justin seem to convey a description
of silken robes. This mode of the first introduction of silk
into China is offered as mere conjecture, for which I have no
other authority in support of, than what is here mentioned, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the circumstance of the Jews being settled chiefly in the silk
provinces, and of their being at this time in considerable numbers
near <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>, where they carry on the principal
trade in this article, and have acquired the reputation of fabricating
the best stuffs of this material that are made in China;
nor do I know in what other way they could recommend themselves
to the Chinese, so far as to have obtained the protection
of this jealous government, and to be allowed to intermarry
with the women of the country. It is true they have practised
no underhand attempts to seduce the natives from their paternal
religion, and to persuade them to embrace their own; and although
they are not very famous for the cultivation of the
sciences, yet they might have rendered themselves extremely
useful in suggesting improvements in many of the arts and manufactures.
Many of them, indeed, forsake the religion of their
forefathers, and arrive at high employments in the state. Few
among them, I understand, except the Rabbis, have any knowledge
of the Hebrew language, and they have long been so intermixed
with the Chinese, that the priests at the present day
are said to find some difficulty in keeping up their congregations.
So different are the effects produced by suffering, instead
of persecuting, religious opinions.</p>

<p>One of the missionaries has given an account of his visit to a
synagogue of Jews in China. He found the priests most rigorously
attached to their old law: nor had they the least knowledge
of any other Jesus having appeared in the world, except
the son of Sirach, of whom, he says, their history makes mention.
If this be really the fact, their ancestors could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
been any part of the ten tribes that were carried into captivity,
but may rather be supposed to have been among the followers
of Alexander's army, which agrees with their own account of
the time they first settled in China. They possessed a copy of
the Pentateuch and some other fragments of the Sacred Writings,
which they had brought along with them from the westward,
but the missionary's information is very imperfect, as he
was ignorant of the Hebrew language<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>Although a very great similarity is observable between many
of the ancient Jewish rites and ceremonies and those in use
among the Chinese, yet there seems to be no reason for supposing
that the latter received any part of their religion from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>ancestors of those Jews that are still in the country. This,
however, is not the case with regard to the priests of Budha,
who, according to the Chinese records, came by the invitation
of one of their Emperors from some part of India, near Thibet,
about the sixtieth year of the Christian era. These priests
succeeded so well in introducing the worship of Budha, that it
continues to this day to be one of the popular religions of the
country; and that no traces of the original name should remain
is the less surprising, as they could not possibly pronounce either
the B or the D; beside, they make it an invariable rule, as I have
already observed, not to adopt any foreign names.</p>

<p>In some part of the seventh century, a few Christians of the
Nestorian sect passed from India into China where, for a time,
they were tolerated by the government. But, having most
probably presumed upon its indulgence, and endeavoured to
seduce the people from the established religions of the country,
they were exposed to dreadful persecutions, and were at length
entirely extirpated, after numberless instances of their suffering
martyrdom for the opinions they had undertaken to propagate
to the "utmost corners of the earth." When Gengis-Khan
invaded China, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, a
number of Christians of the Greek church followed his army
into this country; and they met with such great encouragement
from the Tartars, that when Kublai-Khan succeeded to the government
and built the city of Pekin, he gave them a grant
of ground within the walls of the city for the purpose of building
a church, in order to retain in the empire men of so much
learning and of abilities so much superior to those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Chinese; who, however, on their part, have affected, in their
history, to consider the Monguls as the greatest barbarians, for
turning their horses into the apartments of the palaces, while
they themselves were contented to pitch their tents in the courts
or quadrangular spaces surrounded by the buildings. Father
Le Compte, in his memoirs of China, says, but I know not on
what authority, that at the taking of the city of Nankin the
Tartars put all the Chinese women in sacks, without regard to
age or rank, and sold them to the highest bidder; and that
such as, in thus "buying the pig in the poke," happened to
purchase an old, ugly, or deformed bargain, made no ceremony
in throwing it into the river. If Father Le Compte was not
the inventor of this, among many other of his pleasant
stories, it certainly tells as little in favour of the Chinese, who
must have been the purchasers, as of the Tartars; but we will
charitably suppose the thing never happened. It seems, however,
that the overthrow of the Chinese empire by the Mongul
Tartars, was an event not to be regretted by the nation at large.
By means of the learned and scientific men, who accompanied
the expedition from Balk and Samarcand, astronomy was improved,
their calendar was corrected, instruments for making
celestial observations were introduced, and the direct communication
between the two extremities of the empire was opened,
by converting the streams of rivers into an artificial bed, forming
an inland navigation, not to be paralleled in any other part
of the world.</p>

<p>It was about this period when the celebrated Venetian traveller
Marco Polo visited the Tartar Khan, then sitting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
throne of China; and who, on his return, gave the first accounts
of this extraordinary empire; which appeared indeed so
wonderful that they were generally considered as his own inventions.
His relations of the magnificent and splendid palaces
of the Emperor, of his immense wealth, of the extent of his
empire, and the vast multitudes of people, were held to be so
many fabrications; and as, in speaking of these subjects, he
seldom made use of a lower term than millions, his countrymen
bestowed upon him the epithet of <i>Signor Marco Millione</i>&mdash;Mr.
Mark Million. They had no hesitation, however, in giving
credit to the only incredible part of his narrative, where he
relates a few miracles that were performed, in the course of his
journey through Persia, by some Nestorean Christians. Young
Marco is said to have accompanied three missionaries of the
Dominican order, sent from Venice to the capital of China,
at the express desire of Kublai-Khan; but, whether they met
with little encouragement in the object of their mission, on
account of being preceded by the Christians of the Greek
church, or their zeal at that time was less ardent than in later
days, is not stated; but it seems they did not remain long in
the East, returning very soon to their native country much
enriched by their travels.</p>

<p>During the continuance of the Tartar government, which
was not quite a century, great numbers of Mahomedans likewise
found their way from Arabia to China. These people had
long, indeed, been in the habit of carrying on a commercial
intercourse with the Chinese; which, however, as at the present
day, extended no further than the sea-ports on the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
coast. They now found no difficulty in getting access to the
capital, where they rendered themselves particularly useful in
adjusting the chronology of the nation, and making the necessary
calculations for the yearly calendar. Having acquired the
language and adopted the dress and manners of the people,
by degrees they turned their thoughts to the extending of their
religious principles, and bringing the whole country to embrace
the doctrine of their great prophet. For this end, they bought
and educated at their own expence such children of poor
people as were likely to be exposed in times of famine; and
they employed persons to pick up, in the streets of the capital,
any infants that should be thrown out in the course of the
night, and who were not too much weakened or otherwise
injured to be recovered.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century, several Roman
Catholic missionaries, of the order of Jesus, penetrated into the
East; and the indefatigable zeal of one of these, Francis Xavier,
carried him as far as <i>San-Shian</i>, a small island on the coast of
China, where he died in the year 1552, in consequence of the
uncommon fatigues he had undergone. His brother missionaries
have calculated that he travelled, on foot, not less than one
hundred thousand English miles, a great part of which was over
mountains and desarts and forests and burning sands. Since
a more easy communication with India and China has been
effected by the way of the Cape of Good Hope, numbers of
missionaries of the Catholic religion have volunteered their services
into those countries; and although the sole object of their
mission is the propagation of the Christian faith, they find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
necessary, in order to forward that object, to make themselves
useful to the government. In China, they are occasionally employed
as astronomers, mathematicians, mechanics, and interpreters.
"It must have appeared a singular spectacle," observes
Sir George Staunton, "to every class of beholders, to see men
actuated by motives different from those of most human
actions, quitting for ever their country and their connexions,
to devote themselves for life to the purposes of changing
the tenets of a people they had never seen; and in pursuing
that object to run every risk, suffer every persecution, and
sacrifice every comfort; insinuating themselves, by address,
by talent, by perseverance, by humility, by application to
studies foreign from their original education, or by the cultivation
of arts to which they had not been bred, into notice
and protection; overcoming the prejudices of being strangers
in a country where most strangers were prohibited, and where
it was a crime to have <i>abandoned the tombs of their ancestors</i>,
and gaining, at length, establishments necessary for the propagation
of their faith, without turning their influence to any
personal advantage."</p>

<p>Most of those, however, who were established in Pekin, to
the spiritual consolation of having laboured in the vineyard of
the gospel not altogether in vain (for they do sometimes gain
a proselyte) add the substantial satisfaction of not having neglected
their worldly concerns. Besides the emoluments arising
from their several communities, they have shops and houses in
the capital, which they rent to Chinese. They have also their
country villas and estates, where they cultivate the vine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
other fruits, and make their own wine. The revenues of the
two Portuguese seminaries are stated to amount to twelve
thousand ounces of silver, or four thousand pounds a year.
The mission <i>de propaganda fide</i> is poor. The French Jesuits
were once rich; but their property was dissipated on the dissolution
of their society. The French <i>missions étrangères</i> drew on
their superiors at Paris before the revolution, but since that event
are reduced to a most deplorable situation. And it seemed to
me, from what I could perceive at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, that they
were not much disposed to assist one another. Each nation
had its separate interest, and they were not willing to lose any
opportunity of calumniating their fellow-labourers. The French
and Italians were the most moderate and liberal; the Portuguese
the most inveterate. The missionaries of this nation appeared
to be inspired with a jealousy and hatred, more than theological,
against the rest. It is said indeed that their rich possessions, and
the high situations they unworthily hold in the board of mathematics,
render them jealous of all other Europeans; and they
use every means of excluding them from the country.</p>

<p>From the frequent dissensions, indeed, among the different
orders, and their perpetual broils, originated the persecutions
which they and their proselytes suffered in China. The most
violent of these disputes was carried on between the Jesuits
and the Dominicans. The Jesuits endeavoured to assimilate
their doctrines and their opinions to those of the Chinese, at
least as far as they conscientiously could venture to do, in conformity
to the nature of their mission; by which means, together
with their apparently disinterested conduct, they soon collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
a numerous set of followers, half Christians and half Pagans.
Unluckily for the cause of Christianity, a different sect of the
same religion, but with principles more austere and of course
less tolerant of others that deviated from their own, speedily
followed the Jesuits into the East. The Dominicans, meeting
with some of the half-christianized converts, soon gave them
to understand that nothing less than eternal damnation would
be the lot of all such as did not forsake their ancient superstitious
and idolatrous practices; and especially that of sacrificing
to their deceased relations in the Hall of Ancestors. The Franciscans
having joined the Dominicans they represented to the
Pope the abominable practices of the Jesuits, who had persuaded
the Chinese they were come among them for the sole purpose of
restoring their ancient religion to its original purity, as delivered
by their Great Philosopher Confucius. The Pope, upon
this, sent over a bull, interdicting all the missionaries in China
from admitting any extraneous ceremonies or idolatrous worship,
to be blended with those of Holy Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, however, by their superior talents, having made
themselves useful at court, and obtained the notice and protection
of <i>Caung-shee</i> the ruling monarch, and the greatest perhaps
that ever filled the throne of China, treated this bull with
contempt, and continued to make converts in their own way.
They even obtained from the Emperor a sum of money and a
grant of land, towards building a church in Pekin. And they
further managed their affairs so well as to procure, from the succeeding
Pope, a dispensation in favour of their mode of proceeding
to convert the Chinese to Christianity. The Domini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>cans
and Franciscans, piqued beyond measure at the success of
the Jesuits, represented them to the Pope, in the strongest terms,
as the greatest enemies to the Christian faith. The Jesuits, in
their turn, transmitted to Rome a manifesto, signed by the Emperor
himself, attesting that the ceremonies of homage to the
dead, retained by the Chinese Christians, were not of a religious
but a civil nature, agreeable to the long established laws of the
empire, which could not, on any consideration, be dispensed
with. In short, their disputes and quarrels ran so high,
and proceeded to such lengths; and Bulls and Embassadors
were sent from Rome, with such imperious and threatening
commands for the Chinese Christians to desist from all ceremonies
that were not warranted by the Catholic church, that the
Emperor began to think it was high time to interpose his authority,
and to interdict the Christian religion from being preached
at all in his dominions. And his son and successor <i>Yung-chin</i>
commenced his reign with violent persecutions against the missionaries.
He ordered many of them immediately out of the
empire; others were thrown into prison<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, where they lingered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>out a miserable life; and some were put to death by the bow-string.
Those few, who were found necessary to assist in the
astronomical part of the calendar, he allowed to remain in the
capital.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the persecutions that, in every reign, have been
violently carried on against them by the officers of government
in the several provinces, numbers of new missionaries have continued,
from time to time, to steal into the country. At Macao
we found two young missionaries, who had been waiting there
a long time, in vain, for an opportunity of getting privately
into the country. They accused the Portuguese of throwing
every obstacle in their way, while pretending to afford them
assistance; but, on application to the British Embassador, he
found no difficulty in procuring them leave to proceed to the
capital; and as one of these gentlemen had been a pupil of the
celebrated La Lande, his services may probably supersede those
of the right reverend bishop who at present directs the astronomical
part of the important national almanack.</p>

<p>From the short view that has here been taken of the different
people who, at various times, have gained admission into
China, and some of them for no other purpose than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
disseminating their religious tenets, it may be concluded, that
the primitive worship of the country has experienced many
changes and innovations, especially since the mass of the people,
from the nature of the language, the maxims of the government,
and other circumstances, have always been kept in a state
of profound ignorance. Jews, Christians, Indians, and Mahomedans,
have severally met with encouragement. The Jesuits
had but one obstacle to overcome, the law that directed offerings
to be made to deceased relations, and by giving way to
this, which they were inclined to do had they not been
thwarted by the more rigorous Dominicans, they might have
converted the whole nation and Christianity would have become,
in all probability, the prevailing religion, instead of that
introduced from India. The paraphernalia and almost all the
mummeries of the Romish church, the bells, the beads, the
altars, the images, the candles, the dress, and the sanctimonious
deportment of the priests in the hours of devotion, their
chaunting and their incense, were already made familiar to the
people in every temple of <i>Fo</i>. But, as Lord Macartney has
observed, "the prohibition or restriction of sensual gratifications
in a despotic country, where there are so few others, is
difficult to be relished. Confession is repugnant to the close
and suspicious character of the nation, and penance would
but aggravate the misery of him whose inheritance is his
labour, and poverty his punishment. Against it also is the
state of society in China, which excludes women from their
proper share of influence and importance. A religion which
requires that women should at stated times communicate to
priests, in private, their thoughts and actions, must be parti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>cularly
disgusting to a Chinese husband, who had not himself
been suffered to see his wife till the day of his marriage;
and who but seldom allows her afterwards to see even her
near relations of another sex. A religion like that of Mahomet
can only be extended by violence and terror; for the
natural stubbornness of men does not readily give way to
novel impressions; but the mild spirit of the gospel is alone
to be infused through the means of gentleness, persuasion,
and imperceptible perseverance. These are the proper instruments
of conversion, and peculiarly belong to the fair sex,
whose eloquence, on such occasions, gives charms to devotion
and ornaments to truth. The earliest stages of Christianity
received no small support from female agency and
example; and for what shew of religion still appears in <i>our</i>
churches, we are surely not a little indebted to the piety and
attendance of women." Nothing, in fact, more tended to
alarm the Chinese than the imprudent practice of the Romish
missionaries of seducing the Chinese women to their churches
whom, as they avow in their correspondence, they sometimes
coaxed out of their jewels and money; adding, by way of justification,
that it was to promote the service of God.</p>

<p>The primitive religion of China or, at least, those opinions,
rites, and ceremonies that prevailed in the time of Confucius,
(and before that period all seems to be fable and uncertainty)
may be pretty nearly ascertained from the writings that are
ascribed to that philosopher. He maintains in his physics,
that "out of nothing there cannot possibly be produced any
thing;&mdash;that material bodies must have existed from all eter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>nity;&mdash;that
the <i>cause</i> (<i>lee</i>, <i>reason</i>) or principle of things, must
have had a co-existence with the things themselves;&mdash;that,
therefore, this cause is also eternal, infinite, indestructible,
without limits, omnipotent and omnipresent;&mdash;that the central
point of influence (<i>strength</i>) from whence this cause principally
acts, is the blue firmament (<i>tien</i>) from whence its
emanations spread over the whole universe;&mdash;that it is,
therefore, the supreme duty of the prince, in the name of
his subjects, to present offerings to <i>tien</i>, and particularly at the
equinoxes, the one for obtaining a propitious seed-time, and
the other a plentiful harvest."</p>

<p>These offerings to the Deity, it may be observed, were always
placed on a large stone, or heap of stones, erected on the
summit of a high mountain, on the supposition, probably, that
their influence would be so much the greater, in proportion as
they should approach the seat and fountain of creative power;
like the ancient Persians who, according to Herodotus, considered
the whole circle of the Heavens to be the great ruling power
of the universe, to which they also sacrificed on high mountains.
Thus Tacitus, in speaking of the practice of worshipping
the gods on high mountains, observes, that the nearer mortals
can approach the heavens, the more distinctly will their
prayers be heard; and on the same principle, Seneca says, that
the people always strove for the seat next to the image of the
deity in the temples, that their prayers might be the better
heard. Thus also Noah, after quitting the ark, built an altar
on the mountain where it rested, and made a burnt-offering,
whose smoke ascending to heaven was pleasing to the Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
And Abraham was commanded to offer his only son Isaac on a
mountain in the land of Moria; and Balak carried Balaam to
the top of Mount Pisgah to offer a sacrifice there, and to curse
Israel. Thus, indeed, all nations in their infancy adopted the
natural idea of paying adoration to Heaven from high places.</p>

<p>The large stones, or the heaps of stones, that have been appropriated
for religious uses at different times, in almost every
part of the world, might have been introduced, as Lord Kames
supposes, from the custom among savage nations to mark with
a great stone the place where their worthies were interred: that
such worthies being at length deified, in the superstitious notions
of their votaries, the stones that were dedicated to their
memory became essential in every act of religious worship performed
in honour of their new deities. The very particular
homage, that for time immemorial has been paid to the memory
of the dead by the Chinese, renders the above explanation
extremely probable as to the origin of their altar of four
stones which in their language are called <i>Tan</i>, and which in
former times were erected on most of their high mountains;
and it is singular enough that, at the present day, the <i>tan</i>
should be represented, upon many of the altars erected in their
temples, by four loose stones placed on the four corners of the
altar, as the horns were in the corners of the Jewish altars.
When population increased, and the people were spread wide
over the empire, the inconvenience of ascending any particular
mountain must necessarily be felt, and the <i>tan</i> was then
transferred to places that were better suited for general accommodation.
The same idea indeed is still retained in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
churches, the <i>altar</i> and <i>high place</i> being synonimous words. In
the city of Pekin, which stands on a sandy plain, the <i>tien-tan</i>,
or altar of Heaven; the <i>tee-tan</i> or altar of earth; and the <i>sien-nong-tan</i>
or altar of ancient agriculturists, are erected upon artificial
mounts within the walls of the palace; and here the Emperor
continues, to this day, to sacrifice at appointed times,
exclusively, as the son of Heaven, and the only being on earth
worthy to intercede for his people. The same doctrine prevailed
in the time of Confucius, who observes, that the distance
between the all-creative power, or cause of all things, and the
people is so immeasurably great, that the king or ruler, as high
priest, can alone offer such a sacrifice; and that this power is
best satisfied when man performs the moral duties of life; the
principal of which he makes to consist in filial piety, and unlimited
obedience to the will of the prince.</p>

<p>His religious notions and morals do him great credit, but
his metaphysics are so obscure as not to be intelligible which,
however, may partly be owing to the nature of the language.
In his writings appears a strong predilection for a kind of fortune-telling,
or predicting events by the mystical lines of <i>Fo-shee</i>.
By the help of these lines, and the prevailing element at the
commencement of the reign of a prince, he pretended to foretel
the events that would take place and the length of its continuance;
but, at the same time, he was cautious enough to
wrap them up in such ambiguous and mysterious expressions
that, like most prophecies of the kind, they might admit of a
variety of interpretations. This manner of expounding the
lines of Fo-shee by Confucius, the supposed system of binary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
arithmetic by Leibnitz, laid the foundation of consulting future
destiny, at this day universally sought after by the Chinese<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>Predestination in all ages, and in all nations, has formed one of
the leading features of religion; and, in consideration perhaps
of popular opinion, has been foisted into the articles of the
Christian faith, though unwarranted by any passage in the holy
scriptures. It is a doctrine little calculated for the promotion of
good morals, and still less so for conveying spiritual consolation.
The Chinese, however, confine the influence of lots to the events
of this life. It would perhaps be doing injustice to the understanding
of Confucius to suppose, that he really believed in the
doctrine of fatality. Being prime minister of one of the kings
of China, it was necessary for him to act the politician as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>well as the philosopher; and he could not fail to know, that
the superstitions of the people were among the best supports of
the government. He might have been aware of the folly and
absurdity of such a doctrine, and yet found it prudent to enforce
the observance of it; just as the Greeks thought proper
to continue their <i>Lots</i>. These, instead of sticks, as used by the
Chinese, were three stones that, according to some, were first
discovered and presented to Pallas by the nymphs, the daughters
of Jupiter, who rejected an offering that rather belonged to
Apollo, and threw them away;&mdash;an excellent moral, observes
Doctor Tytler, the learned translator of the hymns and epigrams
of Callimachus, shewing that those persons who are
guided by Pallas, or Wisdom, will improve the present time,
without being too anxious to pry into futurity. The Greek
poet, however, like the Chinese philosopher, ascribed to the
possessor of the Lots, the talent of reading future destiny.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 40%;">
<div class="poem">
"By him the sure events of Lots are given;<br />
By him the prophet speaks the will of Heaven."<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><span class="smcap">Tytler.</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Romans had also their lots to determine future events,
which were a kind of wooden dice, and their priests examined
the marks and interpreted the signification of the throw. And
the ancient Germans, according to Tacitus, made use of little
sticks, notched at the ends which, like the Chinese, they
threw three times in case they did not approve of the first
throw. Herodotus traces the custom of predicting future
events to the ancient Egyptians, and seems to think the Greeks
had it from them. But is not the desire of prying into futu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>rity
to be ascribed rather to a weakness in human nature, than
as a custom borrowed by one nation from another? Are we entirely
free from it in modern Europe? However humiliating the
reflection may be, yet it is certainly true, that men of the
strongest minds and soundest judgments have sometimes, towards
the close of an useful life, devoted their time to the exposition
of old prophecies without meaning, or applicable only
to events that were already in train to be accomplished when
the prediction was made. Among many others, the great
<i>Napier</i>, the inventor of logarithms, might be produced as an
instance of this remark. From the Apocalypse of Saint John
he predicted the day of judgment; but his calculations in this
instance not being founded on <i>data</i> equally solid with those on
which he constructed his tables, he unfortunately survived the
day he had named to blush at his own weakness.</p>

<p>Other parts of the doctrine of Confucius were well calculated
to keep alive the superstitious notions that still prevail among
the multitude. He taught them to believe that the human
body was composed of two principles, the one light, invisible,
and ascending; the other gross, palpable, and descending; that
the separation of these two principles cause the death of man;
that at this awful period the light and spiritual part of the human
body ascends into the air, whilst the gross and corporeal
matter sinks into the earth. The word <i>death</i>, in fact, never
enters into the philosophy of Confucius; nor, indeed, on
common occasions is it employed by the Chinese at the present
day. When a person departs this life, the common expression
is, <i>he has returned to his family</i>. And although the body re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>solves
itself in the course of time into its primitive elements, and
becomes a part of the universe; yet, he contended, the spirits
of such as had performed their duty in life were permitted to
visit their ancient habitations, or such places as might be appointed
for receiving the homage of their descendants, on
whom they had the power of conferring benefactions. On this
ground it became the indispensable duty of every good man to
observe a strict obedience of the performance of sacred rites in
the temple consecrated to the memory of ancestors. He maintained
that all such as neglected this great branch of moral duty
would be punished for their neglect, after death, by their spiritual
part being deprived of the privilege of visiting the hall of
ancestors; and, consequently, of the pleasure arising from the
homage bestowed by their descendants. Such a system could
not fail to establish a belief in good and evil genii, and of tutelar
spirits presiding over families, towns, cities, houses, mountains,
and other particular places. It afterwards required no
great stretch of the imagination to give to these "airy nothings
a local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>It does not appear, however, that either Confucius or any
of his disciples attached the least idea of a <i>personal being</i> to the
deity; nor does it seem ever to have entered into their minds
to represent the <i>great first cause</i> under any image or personification.
They considered the sun, moon, stars and the elements,
with the azure firmament, as the creative and productive powers,
the immediate agents of the Deity and inseparably connected
with him, and they offered adoration to these agents, united in
one word <i>tien</i> (Heaven). It cannot be supposed, after what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
has already been observed in the sixth chapter, that I should
lay any stress on the similarity of words in different languages,
or on the analogy of their signification, in order to prove a common
origin; but if the conjecture of the learned Bos be right,
that <ins title="Theos">&#920;&#949;&#959;&#962;</ins> may be derived from <ins title="Theein">&#920;&#949;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins> to move forward, in allusion
to the motion of the heavenly bodies which the ancient
Greeks, as well as the Persians, worshipped, <i>tien</i> certainly comes
very near the Greek both in sound and signification; nearer it
could not come in sound, as the Chinese by no effort could pronounce
the <ins title="Theta">&#920;</ins> <i>th</i>. The word <i>tien</i> not only signifies <i>heaven</i>, but
a revolution of the heavenly bodies, and is in common use both
in writing and conversation for <i>day</i>, as <i>ye, ul, san tien</i>, one, two,
three days.</p>

<p>The Confucionists, like the Stoics, seem to have considered
the whole universe as one animated system, made up of one
material substance and one spirit, of which every living thing
was an emanation, and to which, when separated by death from
the material part it had animated, every living thing again returned.
In a word, their conceptions of the Deity might be summed
up in those two beautiful and expressive lines of Pope,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,<br />
Whose body nature is, and God the soul."<br />
</div></div>

<p>But that which is most surprizing is, that the enthusiastic followers
of Confucius have never erected any statue to his memory,
nor paid him divine honours as erroneously has been
supposed. In every city is a public building, a kind of college,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
wherein examinations are held for degrees of office, and this
building is called the house of Confucius. Here, on certain
appointed days, the men of letters assemble to pay respect to
the memory of their esteemed philosopher. In the great hall
appropriated for this ceremony a plain tablet is erected, on
which is painted an inscription, in gilt characters, to this effect:
"O <i>Cong-foo-tse</i>, our revered master, let thy spiritual part
descend and be pleased with this our respect which we now
humbly offer to thee!" Fruit and wine, flowers, perfumes
and other articles are then placed before the tablet, during
which are also burning various kinds of scented gums, frankincense,
tapers of sandal wood and gilt paper. This ceremony,
which in every respect is the same to that which he taught as
an observance towards the manes of departed relations, they are
persuaded is agreeable to the invisible spirits of those to whom
it is offered, who delight in hovering over the grateful odour of
flowers, of fruit, and the smoke of incense. Thus, in like manner,
did the Romans on their birth-days offer flowers and
fruit and wine, and burn incense to invisible spirits, whom
they called the <i>genii</i>,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"Funde merum genio."<br />
"Fill a glass to Genius."<br />
</div></div>

<p>But the priests, who, in all ages and in most nations, have
been crafty enough to turn to their own account the credulity
and superstitions of the people, having once established as a
religious duty the offering of sweet-smelling herbs and other
perfumes, found little difficulty in persuading the multitude, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
that the tutelar spirits could eat as well as smell, and that sacrifices
and meat-offerings would be acceptable to the gods. The priests
of China lost no time in introducing sacrifices, even of living
creatures, and offerings of corn and rice and wine and precious
metals upon their altars, not however to that extent
which was practised in the temples of Greece and Rome, whose
gods were the most mercenary of all nations, being rarely induced
to grant a favour without a fee. Nor in modern days
have the monks and priests of the Catholic faith been backward in
this respect particularly in sanctioning the doctrine of <i>composition
for sins</i>, for the absolution of which the rate was not even fixed
in proportion to the magnitude; and what is still more astonishing,
this impious practice of bargaining with the Almighty has
survived the dark ages, and exists to a certain degree at this
moment.</p>

<p>The moral and religious opinions of Confucius were, in fact,
too sublime and too metaphysical to preserve their purity among
a people so unprepared, as his countrymen were, to receive and
cherish them. The attention of the multitude would seem, indeed,
in all nations to require being fixed on something gross
and material. How difficult was it for the priest and the leader
of the Jews, to restrain their people from practices of idolatry.
In the short absence even of Moses on Mount Sinai, they made
for themselves a molten calf of gold as an object of divine worship,
in imitation, probably, of what they had beheld in the
temples of Egypt. The invisible god made little impression
on their gross and untutored understandings. Nor was Numa
more successful than Moses or Confucius, in his attempt to esta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>blish
among the people the worship of an ideal or mental object
of adoration. Thus also it happened with the Chinese.
The sublime conceptions of their great philosopher, too refined
indeed for untutored human nature, they could not comprehend.
They required some visible object on which they
might fix their attention. It was not enough merely to imagine
that the spirits of men, who had done their duty in this
life, were permitted to haunt the places where their bodies were
interred, or where their surviving friends should assemble to
do them honour: it was necessary to give them a form and substance.
In the same manner was the purity of the Christian religion
contaminated by the multitude of images that were invented
in the monkish ages, when every city, town, and church,
and even individuals, provided they could pay for them, had
their particular patron, or tutelar saint.</p>

<p>Like the temples of Confucius, those of the ancient Egyptians
are supposed to have been entirely free from statues; and
Herodotus seems to be of opinion, that Hesiod and Homer
were the first who introduced the genealogy of the gods among
the Greeks; imposed names upon each, assigned their functions
and their honours, and clothed them in their several
forms. And we learn from Silius Italicus, that the ancient
temple of Hercules at Gades had no visible type of the Deity.</p>

<p>The missionaries in their writings have endeavoured to impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the world with an idea that the Chinese, and particularly the Confucionists,
are atheists; that they disbelieve in a future state of
existence; and that they are the victims of a senseless superstition.
Nothing can be more unjust than such an accusation.
Could <i>Caung-shee</i> be an atheist, when he inscribed with his own
hands the Jesuit church in Pekin,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"To the only true principle of all things," &amp;c.
</div></div>

<p>And can a people be justly accused of a disbelief in a state of
future existence, when the whole nation, of what sect soever,
presents its offerings at stated seasons to the <i>spirits</i> of its departed
ancestors? Does the ejaculation, "Let thy spiritual part
descend and be pleased with this our respect which we now
humbly offer to thee!" convey any such supposition? And
of all others, the missionaries ought to have been the last to accuse
the Chinese of senseless superstitions. Surely it is not
more repugnant to reason, nor less consonant with human feelings,
to offer grateful gifts to the manes of deceased parents and
friends, than to fall down before the Virgin Mary and the
thousand saints whom caprice or cabal have foisted into their
calendar, and of whose history and actions even their votaries are
totally ignorant? Chinese superstition, in this respect is, to say
the worst of it, an amiable weakness. If the supposition be
allowed that beings who have departed this life may possess
an influence over remaining mortals, it is surely more natural
to address those whose care and kindness had already been felt,
than those of whom we have no further knowledge than the
name. There is perhaps no stronger incentive to virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
actions, nor a more effectual check against vicious pursuits,
than the idea that the departed spirit of a beloved parent may
continue to watch over and direct our conduct. The Chinese, at
all events, are not illiberal in their superstitions: they made not
the least difficulty in allowing the corpse of one of our artists,
who died at <i>Tong-tchoo</i>, though a Christian and consequently
in their opinion a heretic, to be deposited in the midst of their
public burying ground. With as little reason does an angry missionary
complain of the dresses and ceremonies of their priests,
as they certainly borrowed nothing from the Catholics, who,
on their part, are much indebted to the heathen Greeks for a
great part of the paraphernalia of their own religion. "There
is no country," says he, "where the devil has so successfully
counterfeited the true worship of the holy church.
These priests of the infernal spirit wear long loose gowns,
exactly resembling those of some of the fathers of the church;
they live in temples like so many monasteries, and they chaunt
in the same manner as with us."</p>

<p>Another religion, much better calculated to gain popularity,
sprung up about the time of, or very shortly after, the death
of Confucius. A man of the name of <i>Lao-Kung</i>, having travelled
into Thibet, became in part acquainted with the worship
of the priests of Lama, which he thought would suit his
countrymen, and might also be the means of raising his own reputation.
He accordingly established a sect, under the name of
<i>Tao-tze</i>, or "Sons of Immortals." He maintained, like Epicurus,
that to live at his ease and to make himself happy were
the chief concerns of man: that, to seize the present moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
regardless of the past and of that to come, was the business
of life,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 40%;">
<div class="poem">
"Carpe diem, quàm minimum credula postero."<br />
<br />
"&mdash;&mdash;Swift the fleeting pleasure seize,<br />
Nor trust to-morrow's doubtful light."<br />
</div></div>

<p>But as ills would come, and disease and death seemed to be the
common lot of mankind, the beverage of immortal life was a
glorious idea to hold out to mortal man. In fact, immortality
was one of the attributes of the <i>Delai Lama</i>, who is supposed
never to die; the soul of the reigning Lama passing immediately
into the person of his successor. This doctrine, a branch of
the Metempsycosis, was converted by <i>Lao-Kung</i> into the art of
producing a renovation of the faculties in the same body, by
the means of certain preparations taken from the three kingdoms
of nature. The infatuated people flew with avidity to
the fountain of life. Princes even sought after the draughts
that should render them immortal, but which, in fact, brought
on premature death. Numerous instances are said to be on
record, wherein the eunuchs have prevailed on the sovereign
to swallow the immortal liquor which seldom failed to dispatch
him. Father Trigault, who was in Pekin when the Tartars
took possession of it, speaking of the propensity of the upper
classes for the beverage of life, observes, "Even in this city,
there are few of the magistrates or eunuchs or others in
office free from this insanity; and as there are plenty who
wish to learn the secret, there is no want of professors." This
seems to be the only species of alchemy to which the Jesuits
have said the Chinese are addicted. The preparation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
liquor of life is their philosopher's stone; and, in all probability,
is composed of opium and other drugs which, by
encreasing the stimulus, gives a momentary exhilaration to the
spirits; and the succeeding languor requiring another and another
draught till at length, the excitability being entirely exhausted,
the patient "puts on immortality."</p>

<p>How much soever we may find ourselves disposed to censure
the absurdity of the Chinese beverage of life, we are not a great
way behind them in this respect, or the <i>Perkinses</i>, the <i>Solomons</i>,
the <i>Velnos</i>, and the <i>Brodums</i>, with an innumerable host of quacks,
whose indecent advertisements disgrace our daily prints, would
not derive their subsistence, much less rise to affluence, by the
credulity of Englishmen; for many of these pests of society are
foreigners, too contemptible in their own country to meet with
encouragement. What conclusion would a Chinese be apt to
draw of our national character, if he had only a smattering of
our language, just sufficient to enable him to read these daily
effusions that are forced upon public notice<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>? And what must
he think of the reveries of Condorcet, and of his English disciples,
whose monstrous doctrines (under the abused name of
philosophy) would persuade him that sleep was a disease! That</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p><p>was a bodily infirmity, which the <i>perfectibility of the human
mind</i> (so happily commenced by the French subversion) would
completely eradicate! Let us not altogether condemn the ignorant,
perhaps designing, priests of <i>Tao-tse</i>, and the still more
ignorant multitude, when the strong and enlightened mind of a
<i>Descartes</i> could amuse itself with the fanciful hope of being able
to discover the secret of prolonging the life of man far beyond
the usual limits which seem to be assigned to the human species.</p>

<p>Consistent with the principle of "taking no thought for the
morrow," the priests of <i>Lao-Kung</i> devoted themselves to a
state of celibacy, as being more free from cares than the incumbrances
which necessarily attend a family connexion; and the
better to accomplish this end, they associated in convents.
Here they deal out to their votaries the decrees of the oracle
agreeably to the rules prescribed by Confucius; and they practice
also a number of incantations, magic, invocations of spirits,
and other mystical rites that are probably as little understood by
themselves as by the gazing multitude. In performing these
magic tricks they march in procession round the altar, on which
the sacred flame is supposed to be kept perpetually burning,
being a composition of wax and tallow mixed up
with sandal wood shavings and other perfumes; they chaunt
in unison a kind of recitative, and they bow their heads obsequiously
every time they pass before the front of the altar.
The great <i>Gong</i> is struck at intervals, accompanied by tinkling
sounds emitted by gently striking small metal plates suspended in
a frame as in the plate of musical instruments. Their temples are
crowded with large and monstrous figures, some made of
wood, some of stone, and others of baked clay daubed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
with paint and varnish, and sometimes gilt. To such figures
however they do not seem to pay any kind of homage. They
are intended merely to represent the good and evil genii under
the various passions to which human nature is liable. The
good genii, or pleasing affections, are placed on one side of the
temple, and their opposites on the other. Thus the personifications
of mirth and melancholy, love and hatred, pleasure
and pain, are contrasted together. The conditions of men are
also represented, and their figures opposed to one another. In
this light at least they appeared to us; though the priest at <i>Tong-tchoo</i>
informed us they were intended to pourtray the different
characters of the monks that had belonged to the monastery. In
some temples also are met with the statues of such Emperors or
ministers of state as had shewn themselves favourable to any
particular convent. If, for instance, a great man should occupy
the apartments of a temple and at his departure leave a considerable
sum of money, the priests, out of gratitude, would
place his image in a niche of the temple. In looking into one
of these edifices a stranger would be apt to conclude that they
were Polytheists, which I do not understand to be the case.
Like the saints of the Catholics the great <i>Fo</i>, of whom I shall
presently speak, with <i>Poo-sa</i>, <i>Shing-moo</i>, and many others, are
considered only in the light of agents and intercessors, or as
emanations of one creating, destroying, and renovating power,
whose good providence has divided itself into a number of
attributes for the better government of the universe<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>Next to this religion of the immortals, was introduced another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
of nearly the same growth which, from being patronized
by the court, soon became no less popular than the former.
The priests of <i>Fo</i>, coming by invitation from India, imported
with them a great portion of the Hindu mythology, which
some learned men have supposed to be the origin from whence
the Polytheism of Egypt and Greece had its source; and others
the direct contrary. Be that as it may, the affinity seems to
be too strong not to ascribe them to a common parent; and
the representations and the histories of many of the gods of
these nations were imported, in all probability, with the religion
of <i>Fo</i>, from India into China. This will better appear by
comparing a few as they are observed in the different nations.</p>

<p>The <i>Budha</i> of the Hindus was the son of <i>Ma ya</i>, and one
of his epithets is <i>Amita</i>: the <i>Fo</i> of China was the son of <i>Mo-ya</i>,
and one of his epithets is <i>Om-e-to</i>; and, in Japan, whose natives
are of Chinese origin, the same god <i>Fo</i> is worshipped under the
name of <i>Amida</i>. I could neither collect from any of the
Chinese what the literal meaning was of <i>Om-e-to</i>, nor could I
decypher the characters under which it is written, but it appeared
to be used as a common ejaculation on most occasions, just as
we Europeans are too apt to make a familiar and impious use of
the name of God. Perhaps it might not seem inconsistent in
considering it to be derived from the Hindu mystic word <i>Om</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the accession of the Tartar princes to the throne of China,
the court religion, or at least the Tartar part of the court, which
before adhered to the tenets of Confucius, has been that of
<i>Fo</i> or <i>Budha</i>. The priests are numerous, mostly dressed in
yellow gowns, live in a state of celibacy in large convents
or temples, which the Chinese call <i>Poo-ta-la</i>, evidently derived
from <i>Budha-laya</i>, or habitation of <i>Budha</i>, this name being
adopted by the Tartars, which the Chinese have been under
the necessity of following as nearly as their organs of speech
would admit. They wear a sort of chapelet round their necks,
consisting of a number of beads. In some of their ceremonies
they march, like the <i>Tao-tses</i>, in procession round the altar, counting
their beads, repeating at every bead <i>Om-e-to-fo</i>, and respectfully
bowing the head. The whole string being finished,
they chalk up a mark, registering in this manner the number of
their ejaculations to <i>Fo</i>. This counting of their beads was one
of the ceremonies that very much exasperated the missionaries.</p>

<p>The <i>Ganesa</i> of the Hindus, the <i>Janus</i> of the Romans, and
the <i>Men-shin</i>, or guardian spirit of the door of the Chinese, are
obviously one and the same deity. Sometimes he is painted
with a club in one hand, and a key in the other, representing
the protector of the house. On almost every door in China,
where the inhabitants profess the religion of <i>Fo</i>, is drawn the
figure of <i>Men-shin</i>, or otherwise the two characters of this
word, agreeing exactly with what Sir William Jones has observed
of the new town of Gayá in Hindostan, "that every
new built house, agreeably to an immemorial usage of the
Hindus, has the name of <i>Ganésa</i> superscribed on its door: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
in the old town his image is placed over the gates of the
temples."</p>

<p>The <i>Vishnu</i> of the Hindus, riding on an eagle, and sometimes
attended by an eagle, has been considered as the <i>Jupiter</i>
of the Greeks; and the <i>Lui-shin</i> of the Chinese, or spirit
of thunder, is figured under a man with the beak and talons of
an eagle, sometimes surrounded with kettle drums, carrying in
one hand a batoon and in the other a flame of fire. The <i>Osiris</i>
of the Egyptians, from whence the Greeks had their <i>Jupiter</i>,
comes still nearer to the <i>Lui-shin</i> of the Chinese. When represented
as the emblem of the sun, he was drawn under the figure
of a man with an eagle's beak, carrying in his hand a batoon
on which was painted an eye. The ingenious and fertile imagination
of the Greeks separated the emblem from the god, and
made the bird of prey the attendant of the divinity, which the
Egyptians and the Chinese united under one symbol. It is a
curious coincidence of opinion, if it be not founded on fact,
that the Chinese should assign the same reason for giving an
eagle's face to their <i>Lui-shin</i>, that Pliny has for the consecration
of that bird to <i>Jupiter</i>, namely, that no instance was ever
known of an eagle being destroyed by lightning. The Chinese
have also an observation with regard to this bird, which has
been made by other nations, and which is, that the eagle, in a
thunder storm, always mounts above the clouds.</p>

<p>The <i>Varuna</i> of the Hindus, riding on a fish, the <i>Neptune</i>
of the Greeks, and the Chinese <i>Hai-vang</i>, or king of the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
reposing on the waves, with a fish in his hand, are unquestionably
one and the same personage.</p>

<p>The giant <i>Briareus</i>, with his hundred hands, is truly in
China of a most stupendous and colossal stature, being commonly
from fifty to sixty feet in height, and sometimes as tall
as eighty feet. But the largest of all their deities is a woman
of the family of <i>Poo-sa</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, apparently a personification of nature.
This goddess is modelled in a variety of ways; sometimes she
is to be found with four heads, and forty or fifty arms, the
heads looking towards the four cardinal points of the compass,
and each arm holding some natural product of the earth subservient
to the use of man. Sometimes each arm produces several
smaller arms, and on the head stands a pyramidal groupe
of smaller heads. Van Braam mentions his having seen a
statue of this goddess that was ninety feet high, having four
heads and forty-four arms. It is no uncommon thing to meet
with temples in ruins, in the midst of which these monstrous
gods and goddesses are seen entire, exposed to the elements. It
seems the inferior temples are generally upheld by the voluntary
gifts of the people; and that, whenever any unusual calamity
befals a town or village, such as severe famine, epidemic
disease, inundations, or the like, whose dire effects cease not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>on repeated applications to the protecting saint, by way of
punishing the gods, they literally pull down the temple over
their heads, and leave them sitting in the open air. The grotesque
and barbarous manner of representing the manifold powers of
nature, or the goddess of nature, by a plurality of heads and
hands in one idol, is by no means favourable to the supposition
of a refined or superior understanding in the people who adopt
them into their religious worship. It can be considered only as
a very short step beyond the conceptions of savages, who have
no other idea than that of supplying by number, or a repetition
of the same thing, what may be wanting in power. The same
figure, with numerous arms, appears in the Hindu temples
that are excavated out of solid granite mountains, the most ancient
and among the most wonderful monuments of art and
persevering labour that have hitherto been discovered on the
face of the globe, the fountain perhaps from whence the arts,
the sciences, and the religious mysteries of the Egyptians and
the Greeks derived their origin.</p>

<p>But the most common of all the female deities in China
is the <i>Shing-moo</i>, or holy mother, or rather the mother of
<i>perfect intelligence</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. This lady is the exact counterpart of the
Indian <i>Ganga</i> or goddess of the river, the <i>Isis</i> of the Egyptians,
and the <i>Ceres</i> of the Greeks. Nothing shocked the missionaries so
much on their first arrival in China as the image of this lady,
in whom they discovered, or thought they discovered, the most
striking resemblance to the Virgin Mary. They found her ge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>nerally
shut up with great care in a recess at the back part of
the altar, and veiled with a silken screen to hide her from
common observation; sometimes with a child in her hand, at
other times on her knee, and a glory round her head. On
hearing the story of the <i>Shing-moo</i> they were confirmed in this
opinion. They were told that she conceived and bore a son
while yet a virgin, by eating the flower of the <i>Lien-wha</i> (the
<i>Nelumbium</i>) which she found lying upon her clothes on the
bank of a river where she was bathing: that, when the time
of her gestation was expired, she went to the place where she
had picked up the flower and was there delivered of a boy;
that the infant was found and educated by a poor fisherman; and,
in process of time, became a great man and performed miracles.
Such is her story, as told by the Chinese priests. When
the image of this goddess is standing, she generally holds a
flower of the Nelumbium in her hand; and when sitting, she is
usually placed upon the large peltate leaf of the same plant.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Lotos, not that esculent plant from the use
of which the <i>Lotophagi</i> had their name, but another of a very
different genus consecrated to religious purposes, is said<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> to
have been ascertained from a statue of <i>Osiris</i>, preserved in the
Barberini palace at Rome, to be that species of water lilly which
grows in abundance in most parts of the eastern world, and
which was known to botanists under the name of <i>Nymphæa Nelumbo</i>;
but I understand it is now considered as a new <i>genus</i>, distinguished
under a modification of its former specific name, by that
of <i>Nelumbium</i>. This plant, however, is no longer to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
Egypt. The two species that grow, at present, on the banks
and canals of the Nile are totally different, which furnishes a
very strong presumption that, although a sacred plant and cultivated
in the country, it might nevertheless be of foreign
growth. In China, few temples are without some representation
of the Nelumbium; sometimes the <i>Shing-moo</i> is painted as
standing upon its leaves in the midst of a lake. In one temple
I observed the intelligent mother sitting upon the broad peltate
leaf of this plant, which had been hewn out of the living
rock. Sometimes she holds in her hand a cornucopia filled with
the ears of rice, of millet, and of the capsule or seed-vessel of
the Nelumbium, these being articles of food which fall to the
share of the poorest peasant. This very beautiful water lilly
grows spontaneously in almost every lake and morass, from the
middle of Tartary to the province of Canton; a curious circumstance,
when we consider the very great difficulty with which it
can be preserved, even by artificial means, in climates of Europe,
whose temperature are less warm and less cold than many of
those where, in China, it grows in a state of nature, and with
the greatest degree of luxuriance. On the heights of Tartary
it is found in an uncultivated state where, in winter, the thermometer
frequently stands at, and generally far below, the freezing
point. But here the roots strike at the bottom of very deep
waters only, a circumstance from which we may perhaps conclude,
that the plant may rather require uniformity of temperature,
than any extraordinary degree either one way or other.
Not only the seed of the Nelumbium, which is a kind of nut
nearly as large as an acorn, but the long roots, jointed like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
canes, furnish articles of food for the table. In the capital, during
the whole summer season, the latter are sliced and laid on
ice, and in this state serve as part of the desert; the taste differs
very little from that of a good juicy turnip, with a slight degree
of astringency.</p>

<p>There is something so very striking and remarkable in this
plant, that it is not surprizing the Egyptians and the Indians,
fond of drawing allusions from natural objects, should have
considered it as emblematic of creative power. The leaves of
the succeeding plant are found involved in the middle of the
seed, perfect, and of a beautiful green. When the sun goes
down, the large leaves that spread themselves over the surface
of the water close like an umbrella, and the returning sun gradually
unfolds them. Now, as these nations considered water
to be the primary element, and the first medium on which creative
influence began to act, a plant of such singularity, luxuriance,
utility and beauty, could not fail to be regarded by them
as a proper symbol for representing that creative power, and
was accordingly consecrated by the former to <i>Osiris</i> and to <i>Isis</i>,
the emblems of the sun and moon, and by the latter to <i>Ganga</i>,
the river goddess, and to the sun. The coincidence of ideas between
those two nations, in this respect, may be drawn from
that beautiful Hindu hymn, addressed to Surya or the sun, and
translated by Sir William Jones&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">

</div></div>

<p>Whether the Chinese, like the Hindus, entertained the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
notions of creative power, or its influence upon water as the
primary element, I could not learn. No information as to the
ground-work of their religion is to be looked for from the
priests of the present day, who are generally very ignorant; but
I suspect the dedication of the Lotos to sacred uses to be much
older than the introduction of Hindu mythology by the priests
of Budha. They even ascribe the fable of eating the flower to
the mother of their first Emperor <i>Foo-shee</i>; and the Lotos and
the lady are equally respected by all the sects in China; and
even by the Mantchoo Tartars, whose history commences with
the identical story of a young virgin conceiving and bearing a
son, who was to be the progenitor of a race of conquerors, by
eating the flower of a water lilly. If, indeed, any dependence
is to be placed on the following well known inscription found
on an ancient monument of Osiris, Egyptian rites may be supposed
to have made their way into the east and probably into
China, or, on the other hand, those of the east adopted by the
Egyptians, at a period of very remote antiquity. "Saturn, the
youngest of all the gods, was my father. I am Osiris, who
conducted a large and numerous army as far as the deserts of
India, and travelled over the greatest part of the world,
&amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>It may not, perhaps, be thought improbable (I offer it, however,
merely as conjecture) that the story of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
was known in China at a very early period of the history of
this country. <i>Osiris</i>, king of Egypt, and husband of <i>Isis</i>, was
worshipped under the form of an ox, from his having paid particular
attention to the pursuits of agriculture, and from employing
this animal in the tillage of the ground.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"Primus aratra manu solerti fecit Osiris."<br />
Osiris first constructed ploughs with dext'rous skill.<br />
</div></div>

<p>Historians say, that <i>Isis</i>, on the murder of her husband, enjoined
the priests of Egypt, by a solemn oath, to establish a
form of worship in which divine honours should be paid to
their deceased prince; that they should select what kind of animal
they pleased to represent the person and the divinity of
<i>Osiris</i>, and that they should inter it with solemn funeral honours
when dead. In consideration of this apotheosis, she allotted a
portion of land to each sacerdotal body. The priests were
obliged to make a vow of chastity; their heads were shaven
and they went barefooted. Divine honours were likewise conferred
on <i>Isis</i> after her death, and she was worshipped under
the form of a cow.</p>

<p>Now, although the festival in China, at which the Emperor
holds the plough in the commencement of the spring, be considered
at this day as nothing more than a political institution,
and continued as an example to the lower orders of people, an
incitement for them to pursue the labours of agriculture as the
most important employment in the state;&mdash;yet, as this condescension
of the sovereign militates so strongly against all their
maxims of government, which place an immense distance be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>tween
him and the first of his people, it may not, perhaps, be
much amiss in supposing it to have originated in some religious
opinion. Indeed he still continues to prepare himself for the
solemn occasion, by devoting three days entirely to pious ceremonies
and rigid devotion. On the day appointed by the tribunal
of mathematics, a <i>cow</i> is sacrificed in the <i>Tee-tan</i>, or
temple dedicated to the earth; and on the same day, in some
of the provinces, the figure of a cow of baked clay, of an immense
size, is carried in procession by a number of the peasantry,
followed by the principal officers of government and the
other inhabitants. The horns and the hoofs are gilded and ornamented
with silken ribbons. The prostrations being made
and the offerings placed on the altar, the earthen cow is broken
in pieces and distributed among the people. In like manner
the body of <i>Osiris</i>, worshipped afterwards under the form of
an ox, was distributed by <i>Isis</i> among the priests; and the <i>Isia</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
were long celebrated in Egypt in the same manner as the festival
of holding the plough is at this day observed in China,
both being intended, no doubt, to commemorate the persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>who had rendered the most solid advantages to the state, by the
encouragement they had held out for the cultivation of the
ground.</p>

<p>The disputes, quarrels, persecutions and massacres, that have
happened at various times among the different sects of Christianity
in Europe, have not been much less violent, nor productive
of less dreadful consequences, between the sect of immortals
and that of Fo, in China, whenever the court, or rather the
intriguing eunuchs, seemed to favour the opinions of one sect in
preference to those of the other. Persecutions never failed to
begin whenever either party was fortunate enough to gain over
to its side the chief of the eunuchs, who had always sufficient
influence with the reigning monarch to prevail upon him to
espouse the same cause. They were, however, wars of priests
alone in which the people remained neutral, or took no active
part. Whole monasteries have been levelled with the ground,
and thousands of priests put to death on both sides. Since,
however, the accession of the present Tartar dynasty, they have
met with no particular marks of favour or distinction; and, on
that account, are apparently reconciled to each other; indeed,
they are scarcely distinguishable either by their temples or by
their dress. The prediction of future events being best suited
to the minds of the multitude, and most sought after, the oracle
of fate may be consulted in any temple, whether of <i>Fo</i> or of
<i>Tao-tze</i>. The government interferes not in religious opinions,
and it gives no support to any particular sect, except that of the
Lama, whose priests are paid and maintained as a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Imperial establishment. The Tartar officers of state are likewise
attached to the faith of the Lama, without the absurdities that
have been mixed with it by the immortals.</p>

<p>However strictly the women may be kept at home by the
customs of the country, they are nevertheless permitted, on
certain occasions, to consult their destiny at the altar, without
being exposed to the censure of vulgarity or impropriety. Barren
wives are even encouraged to visit the temples, not so
much for the purpose of knowing their destiny, as under a
firm belief that, by rubbing the bellies of certain little copper
gods, they shall conceive and bear children. But, the women
in general who, from habit, feel little inclination to stir
abroad, except on very pressing occasions, encourage a set of
fortune-tellers, mountebanks and jugglers, who thus pick up a
livelihood by travelling the country and telling fortunes from
house to house. They are known by a wretched squalling
flute on which they play, and are beckoned to call where their
art is required. By being made acquainted with the day and
hour of a person's birth, they pretend to <i>cast his nativity</i>, which
is called <i>Swan-ming</i>, or the art of discovering events by means
of numbers. A Chinese, even in the higher ranks, has no great
idea of a man's learning, if he be ignorant of the <i>Swan-ming</i>. I
was very frequently applied to at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>, by persons in
office, to know if I could tell them their fortune; and it was
difficult to persuade them I had any knowledge of the astronomical
instruments intended for the Emperor, after professing
my ignorance in <i>casting a nativity</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests of both sects are supposed to be no less attentive
in keeping up a perpetual fire burning upon the altars than the
Roman Vestals were in this respect; but no expiation nor punishment
being considered necessary, as in the latter case, they
cannot boast that "flames unextinguish'd on their altars
shine." They are, in fact, frequently extinguished by carelessness
or accident. No virgins attend this holy flame, but the
charge of it is committed generally to young boys under training
for the priesthood. Like the Greeks and the Romans, the
Chinese have also their penates or household gods, which are
not represented under any particular personification, but generally
by a tablet bearing a short inscription and a taper burning
before it. Every ship, however small, has its tablet and
its taper; and within the compass-box or binnacle a taper is
continually kept burning.</p>

<p>In every city, town and village, sometimes in the midst of
woods, in the mountains and most lonely places, are small
temples, the doors of which are continually left open for the
admittance of such as may be desirous of consulting their destiny.
The practical part of Chinese religion may, in fact, be
said to consist in predestination. A priest is not at all necessary
for unravelling the book of fate. If any one be about to undertake
a journey, or to purchase a wife, or to build a house,
or, above all, to bury a deceased relation, and any doubt should
arise in his mind as to the fortunate result of such undertaking,
he repairs to the nearest temple; and, if he should not be able to
read himself, he takes a friend by the hand who can. On the
altar of every temple is placed a wooden cup, filled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
number of small sticks, marked at the extremities with certain
characters. Taking the cup in his hands he shakes it till one
of the sticks falls upon the ground and, having examined the character
upon it, he looks for the corresponding mark in a book
which is generally appended to the wall of the temple. The
lot, in this manner, is cast several times, and if one lucky flick
in three should happen to turn up, he is willing to consider
the omen as favourable; and, if the event should answer the expectation
he has been led to form from the book of fate, he
considers it as a duty to return to the temple and to burn a
sheet or two of painted paper, or of paper covered with tin foil,
and to deposit a few pieces of copper money on the altar, in
token of gratitude for the favour he has received<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. In this
manner is consumed the greatest part of the tin that is carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
to China by the trading companies of Europe. I have already
observed that they have no communion of worship to offer
up, in a public manner, their prayers or thanksgivings.</p>

<p>Formerly it was the custom to bury slaves with emperors and
princes and sometimes also their concubines alive; but this cruel
practice has given way, in modern times, to the more harmless
one of burning representations of their domestics in tin foil,
cut into the shape of human beings, and of placing their statues
in wood or stone upon their graves; this seems to be the
remains of a Scythian or Tartar custom, which, according to
Herodotus, was commonly observed at the funerals of their
sovereigns, when their horses, their slaves, and their concubines
were impaled alive and placed in order round the tyrant's
tomb. The last remains of a relation are interred with all the
honours that the family can afford. I never passed between
the capital and <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i> without observing numbers of
funeral processions. Those of great officers of state would
sometimes extend for nearly half a mile. The train was usually
arranged in the following order. In front marched a priest uncovered,
next a group of musicians with flutes, trumpets, and
cymbals; after these the male relations of the deceased in long
white frocks and behind them the chief mourner, supported by
two friends, whose exertions to prevent him from tearing his
cheeks and hair appeared to be truly ridiculous. Then followed
the coffin, covered by a magnificent canopy and borne
generally by four men, sometimes by eight. After the canopy
the female relations proceeded in chairs, or more generally in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
little covered carts, wearing white frocks like the men, their
hair dishevelled, and broad white fillets bound across their foreheads.
On approaching a bridge or a temple the procession
always halted while the priest burned little images of tin foil,
or let off a few crackers, upon which the noisy <i>gong</i> and the
rest of the band made a flourish.</p>

<p>The famous feast of lanterns, when the whole empire is
lighted up from one extremity to the other, in every possible
way that fancy can suggest, is an ancient religious usage of
which, at the present day, they can give no plausible account.
It is just possible that, among other Egyptian ceremonies, this
may be one derived from a common origin with an annual
illumination of the same kind mentioned by Herodotus; which
was generally observed, from the cataracts of the Nile to the
borders of the Mediterranean, by hanging lamps of different
kinds to the sides of the houses. On this day the Chinese not
only illuminate their houses, but they also exercise their ingenuity
in making transparencies in the shape of different animals,
with which they run through the streets by night. The effect
when perfectly dark is whimsical enough. Birds, beasts, fishes,
and other animals are seen darting through the air, and contending
with each other; some with squibs in their mouths,
breathing fire, and others with crackers in their tails: some
sending out sky-rockets, others rising into pyramids of party-coloured
fire, and others bursting like a mine with violent explosions.
But the most ingenious are those that, Proteus-like,
change their shape from time to time, and under every form
exhibit a different display of fire-works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>I have observed, at the beginning of this chapter, that the
temples are occasionally appropriated to the use of state-officers,
embassadors and other public characters, when travelling
through the country, there being no other houses affording
accommodations equally suitable. On quitting the temple it is
generally thought necessary to perform an act of reverence bordering
on devotion, not however to the Deity, but to the name
of the Emperor inscribed on the altar. This custom, together
with that of depositing rice and other grain, tea and oil at
certain seasons, especially on the day of his nativity, although
perhaps, in the first instance, a token only of respect and gratitude,
and in the other an acknowledgment of his being the
sole proprietary of the soil, are nevertheless acts that tend, from
the sanctity of the place where they are performed, to the encouragement
of idolatry. By thus associating the offerings
made to the Deity and to the Monarch, the vulgar become apt
to magnify the power of the latter and to raise it on a level
with that of the former. A Chinese in speaking of a propitious
event occurring, either in his own or any other country, generally
attributes it to the joint Will of Heaven and the Emperor
of China.</p>

<p>The conversion of the temples into lodging-houses is attended
with some temporal advantages to the priests, by the donations
that are generally made on such occasions. Most of them
being supported entirely by voluntary contributions and trifling
legacies that may be left by pious persons, they are thankful
for the smallest gifts: for as there is little or no connection
between the church and the state, they derive no pay, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
emolument, nor preferment from the latter. The Emperor
pays his own priests, which are those of all his Tartar subjects;
the Chinese Confucionists, or men of learning, and the
state officers contribute to the maintenance of theirs, whether
of <i>Fo</i> or <i>Tao-tze</i>, and the mass of the people, from the prevailing
propensity of enquiring into futurity, afford the means of support
to many thousands, I might perhaps say millions of
priests, by the offerings carried to the altars whenever they find
it necessary to consult the book of fate, which is done on most of
the common occurrences in life.</p>

<p>From the short view I have here taken of the different sects,
I think it may justly be concluded that the primitive religion
of China no longer exists, or exists only in a corrupted state;
that there is at present no national nor scarcely a state religion:
and that the articles of faith are as various as the modes of
worship; in all of which the people appear to be rather actuated
by the dread of evil in this life, than by the fear of punishment
in another: that the duties they perform are more with
a view to appease an angry deity and to avert impending calamities,
than from any hope of obtaining a positive good: that
they rather consult or enquire of their gods what may happen,
than petition them to accomplish or avert it; for a Chinese
can scarcely be said to pray; he is grateful when the event
proves favourable to his wishes; petulant and peevish with his
gods when adverse.</p>

<p>Little as the priests, or the numerous noviciates that are
found in all the principal temples, are employed in the duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
of their office, or in worldly concerns, they are not less uncleanly
in their persons and their apartments than those are whose
time is taken up in providing for the necessities of life. The
room, in which some of us <i>should</i> have slept, was so full of scorpions
and scolopendras, and they crept in such numbers into
our beds, that we were fairly driven out and obliged to swing
our cots in the open air between two trees. Here we were not
much less annoyed by myriads of musquitoes and the unceasing
noise of the chirping cicadas, which continued without intermission
until the still more noisy <i>gong</i> announced the break
of day, and summoned the holy men to their morning devotions.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">n</span> the 8th of October we embarked, for the second time, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the Pei-ho in yachts, however, that were very different from
those on which we had ascended the river, being much smaller
but broader in proportion to their length, and so shallow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
flat-bottomed, that they required little depth of water; yet we
found them sufficiently commodious. Of the necessity of such
a change in the accommodation yachts, on account of the low
state of the river, we were speedily convinced, which, previous
to our embarkation, had been by some attributed to a different
cause. It was supposed that the men in office throughout the
country, piqued at the refusal of the Embassador to submit to
their degrading ceremony, would not fail to retaliate the affront
by depriving us of every little comfort and convenience, and
by otherwise rendering the long journey before us extremely
unpleasant. The character of the people at large justified such
a conclusion; and, I believe, every individual had laid his account
of meeting with difficulties and disagreeable occurrences
on the journey to Canton. In justice, however, to those who
had the superintendence of the embassy, and particularly to the
two most worthy characters <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i>, who were more immediately
connected with its concerns, it is but fair to observe
that no attention was wanting, nor expense spared, to render
our situation as easy and comfortable as possible. Supplies of
every kind were sent on board in the greatest profusion and
with the most scrupulous punctuality. And as a singular proof
of attention shewn to us in the commencement of this journey,
our conductors, having observed that we used milk with our
tea, had purchased two fine cows in full milk, which were put
on board a yacht prepared for their reception, for a supply of
that article. And, it was observed, that whenever the chief officers
of the provinces, through which the embassy was to pass,
prepared an entertainment in honour of the occasion, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
given themselves all possible trouble to render it more acceptable,
by endeavouring to serve it up, as they thought, in the
English style. In some of those feasts we had hogs roasted
whole, that could not have weighed less than fifty pounds;
quarters of mutton, geese, ducks, and fowls roasted or boiled
whole, a mode of cookery altogether different to the practice
of the country, which is chiefly confined to that of stewing
small morsels of meat with greens or rice. The awkward
manner in which they were prepared, being generally burnt
and glazed over with oil, was entitled to and found an ample
excuse in the desire thus testified of pleasing.</p>

<p>From the time that we first embarked in August at the mouth
of the Pey-ho, or White River, until our return, we experienced
only a single shower of rain. It is observed, indeed,
that during the autumnal months the northern provinces enjoy
a cloudless sky; an advantage of which they avail themselves
in thrashing out the different kinds of grain in the field, thus saving
the labour of bearing it into barns or piling it into stacks. It is
either thrashed out on clay floors with flails, similar to our own,
beat out of the ear against the edge of a plank, or trodden by
oxen or buffalos. The grain that we had noticed just striking
into the ear, on ascending the river, was now generally reaped.
It consisted principally of the different species of millet, as before
observed, and a small proportion of <i>polygonum fagopyrum</i>
or buck-wheat. A species of <i>Dolichos</i> or bean, that had been
sown between the drills of the Holcus, or tall millet, was now
in flower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>The range of Fahrenheit's thermometer in the province
of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, during the month of August, was from 80° to
88° in the middle of the day, and during the night it remained
generally about 60° to 64°. In September, the medium temperature
at two o'clock was about 76°; and in October about
68°; but in the latter month, it decreased in the night sometimes
to 44°.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the <i>Pei-ho</i> a light sandy soil chiefly
prevails, with a mixture of argillaceous earth and slimy matter,
interspersed with shining particles of mica: but not a stone of
any magnitude, nor pebbles, nor even gravel occur in the
whole extent of country through which this river is navigable.
The surface, indeed, is so flat and uniform, that the tide,
which rises only nine or ten feet in the gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>,
flows to the distance of thirty miles beyond <i>Tien-sing</i>, or one
hundred and ten miles from the mouth of the river; and it frequently
submerges the whole country, notwithstanding the
great pains bestowed by the inhabitants in raising and keeping
in order artificial banks. Such inundations, although frequently
the causes of great fertility, are sometimes productive
of general calamity, especially if they happen at a season when
the crop is too far advanced. These plains exhibit the appearance
of a more than ordinary incroachment of the land upon
the sea. The general level of the face of the country, at high
water, is not more elevated than two feet above the surface of
the river, of which not only the bed, but also the substratum
of the enclosing banks, are composed entirely of fine sand similar
to that on the shore of the sea. The deepest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
wide gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i> exceeds not twelve fathoms, and the
prodigious number of small sandy islands, just appearing above
the surface, are said to have been created within the records of
history. A great portion of the enormous mass of mud that is
perpetually wafted down the Yellow River, and which was
found by experiment to exceed two million solid feet in an
hour, is borne by a strong current from the Yellow Sea into
the gulph of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, where the stillness of the water allows
it to subside. In the map of Marco Polo, which was most
probably copied by him from one in the possession of Gengis-khan,
or some of the learned men about his court, <i>Tien-sing</i> is
placed upon the sea coast; and a branch of the Yellow River,
after traversing the provinces <i>Kiang-nan</i>, <i>Shan-tung</i>, and part
of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, in the direction nearly of the present canal, discharges
itself into the gulph near the <i>Pei-ho</i>. Were this branch
of the river actually turned, the rapidity with which the gulph
of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i> is filling up is the less surprising, as the only
stream to keep its waters in motion at present is the <i>Pei-ho</i>. It has
been calculated that, by the simple turning of the great river that
falls from Winandermere-lake, the estuary of Morecombe Bay,
which it now crosses, would, in the natural course of events, be
converted in a few years into a green meadow. If the abovementioned
chart be correct, it would prove also that the Mongul
Tartars did actually first bring the grand navigation of China
to the state in which it now appears.</p>

<p>This uniform plain of China afforded little interest to the
traveller. Few trees appeared, except now and then a clump
of firs surrounding a temple, or the plantations contiguous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the dwelling of some officer of government. In such situations
were also large elms, willows, and a species of ash unknown in
Europe. There were no hedge-rows. Property here is divided
only by narrow ditches, serving at the same time for drains, or
by ridges of unploughed ground, as in the common fields of England,
which answer the purpose of foot-paths. These ridges
were generally well covered with that family of running trefoil,
known by the name of <i>Melilotos</i>, intermixed with a species of
<i>Poa</i> or meadow grass, <i>Avena</i> or wild oats, and <i>Briza</i> or quaking
grass. In the ditches, beside the common reed the <i>Arundo phragmites</i>,
were growing two species of <i>Cyperus</i>, and a <i>Scirpus</i> or
club-rush. None of the artificial grasses, usually so called, are
cultivated by the Chinese. It is not an object with them to
fodder their cows for the sake of obtaining a greater quantity
of milk, this nutritive article of food being very sparingly used
either in its raw state or in any preparation; and they are
either ignorant of the processes of converting it into butter and
cheese, or, for certain reasons, prefer to employ the little they
make use of in its original state. Horses are rarely kept for luxury
or for labour; and the few animals employed in agriculture,
which are mostly asses, mules, or buffalos, subsist in the winter
season on chaff and straw; and their chief support in the summer
is derived from the strong grasses that grow in the ditches
and the common reed, with which, in this part of the country,
large tracts of swampy ground are covered.</p>

<p>On approaching <i>Tien-sing</i>, we observed several large fields
cultivated with a vegetable called by the Chinese the <i>Pe-tsai</i>, or
white herb, apparently a species of <i>Brassica</i> or cole; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
insipid in its taste, being not unlike that of the cos-lettuce, it is
held in preference to all other vegetables; and the capital is most
abundantly supplied with it in the summer season fresh from the
gardens in its vicinity and, in the winter, salted and prepared
somewhat in the same manner as the <i>Sour-Krout</i> of the Germans.
We observed also in the gardens, carrots, turnips, black
radishes, a species of asparagus, the <i>Solanum Melongena</i>, a
species of <i>physalis</i> or winter-cherry, water-melons and musk-melons,
pumpkins and cucumbers. Onions and garlic were
common vegetables planted near every peasant's house. The
<i>Trapa</i> or water-caltrops grew in the ditches, the nuts of
which, with the seeds and the roots of the Nelumbium, generally
furnished out our desert; to which, indeed, sometimes
were added tolerably good peaches, dry spongy apples not
unlike quinces in appearance, and pears of an immense size but
of a harsh and austere taste.</p>

<p>However unfavourable the country might be for an extended
cultivation, which did not appear to be the case, the proximity
to the capital would have led one to expect a corresponding
population. Nothing of the kind appeared; the vast numbers
we had observed in ascending the river were drawn from the
distance of many miles out of mere curiosity; the inhabitants
only of the vicinity now shewed themselves; and we were rather
surprized at the fewness of these, as well as at the very ruinous
and miserable condition of almost all the cottages. These mean
huts were built, some of half-burnt bricks and others of clay,
and they were thatched with the straw of grain or with reeds.
Some were enclosed within walls of mud, or with a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
course matting made of reeds, or the stalks of the <i>holcus sorghum</i>,
which enclosure generally contained the families of two or
three generations, the cattle, pigs, poultry, and all the living
creatures belonging to the establishment. The Chinese have a
common saying, that "although there be poverty without
Pekin, there is plenty within its walls." The appearance,
indeed, of all the peasantry in this province was marked with
every indication of poverty; nor was the condition much better
of those who were employed about the vessels which carried
the Embassador and his train. With the greatest thankfulness
they received the offals of our allowance; and the tea-leaves,
which we had used, were sought after by them with avidity
and boiled up for their beverage. A little boiled rice, or millet,
with a few vegetables, commonly the <i>Pe-tsai</i>, and onions fried
in oil, constituted their principal meals, of which they made
only two regular ones in the day, one about ten o'clock
in the morning, and the other at four or five in the afternoon.
They generally however had the frying-pan on the fire at three
or four o'clock in the morning. The wine or liquor, which
we received in large jars, and which was so miserably bad
as not to be used, afforded a great treat to the poor people,
whose circumstances seldom allowed them to taste it. This
liquor is brewed from a mixture of rice and millet, and from
its quickly turning sour seems to have little strength, and to
have undergone a very imperfect degree of fermentation. Their
<i>hot wine</i> is seldom used except by the upper class of people
who, not satisfied with the strong empyreumatic flavour communicated
in the distillation, drink it boiling hot in the midst
of summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>At <i>Tien-sing</i> our principal conductor <i>Sun-ta-gin</i> had prepared
for us a sumptuous entertainment, consisting of excellent
mutton, pork, venison, and poultry of all kinds, a great variety
of confectionary, of fruits then in season, peaches, plumbs,
grapes, chesnuts, walnuts, and water-caltrops. We very soon
found indeed that we were treated with more studied attention,
with a more marked distinction, and with less constraint, than
when we ascended the river. Our dignified conductor made no
difficulty in allowing us to walk on shore as much as we pleased;
but recommended us not to quit the banks of the river for fear
of retarding the yachts or of being left behind. He hinted to
us, at the same time, that the officers <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i> would be
responsible at court for any accident that might happen to us,
so long as we were under the protection of the Emperor.</p>

<p>In passing <i>Tien-sing</i> we found considerable difficulty in
getting our fleet through the immense crowds of shipping of
every description that were collected there to remain for the
winter; among which were about five hundred of the Emperor's
revenue vessels with grain for the capital. The <i>Eu-ho</i>,
or precious river, called also the <i>Yun-leang-ho</i>, or river upon
which grain is transported, falling from the westward, forms,
at the head of this city, a confluence with the <i>Pei-ho</i>. Our
barges were at least four hours in getting through the multitude
of vessels that were moored, for their winter-quarters, in this
small river; which, however, is rendered important by its communication
with the grand artificial canal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>Having passed the fleet of shipping and the suburbs, a plain
extending beyond the reach of sight opened out on the left of
the river, upon which were observed many thousands of small
sandy tumuli, of a conical form, resembling those hillocks which
in myriads are thrown up on the continent of Africa by the
<i>Termites</i>, or white ants. In several parts of this plain were
small buildings, in the form of dwelling-houses, but not exceeding
four or five feet in height; in other places were circular,
semicircular, and square enclosures of stonework, and here
and there were interspersed small pillars of stone or brick and
other erections of every variety of form. This was the first
common burying-ground that we had observed, except a very
small one at <i>Tong-tchoo</i>; and the tumuli and the different
erections marked out the mansions of the dead. In many parts
of this extensive enclosure we met with massy coffins lying
upon the surface, some new, others newly painted, but none in
a mouldering state. It was explained to us, by our interpreter,
that some of these coffins had been deposited there, until the
proper advice should be obtained from the priest or the oracle
consulted, or from casting lots, as to the most propitious place
of interment, and the most favourable day for performing the
obsequies; some were placed there till the pecuniary circumstances
of the surviving relatives would enable them to bestow a
suitable interment, and others were left to dry and moulder, to
a certain degree, in order to be burnt and the ashes collected
and put into stone jaw or other receptacles<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. On no occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>do the Chinese bury their dead within the precincts of a city or
town, much less within the walls of their temples; but always
deposit them at a proper distance from the dwellings of the
living, in which respect they have more discretion than the
Europeans; who not only allow the interment of dead bodies
in the midst of their populous cities, but have thrust them also
into places of public worship, where crowded congregations
are constantly exposed to the nauseous effluvia, and perhaps
infection, arising from putrid carcases. Yet so tenacious are
the people of the privilege of interment within the walls of the
church, in some countries of Europe, that any attempt to discontinue
the imprudent custom would be attended with some
degree of danger, as happened to the late Grand Duke of Tuscany
who, having built a commodious and spacious cemetery
without the city of Florence, to which it was intended to
remove the coffins out of the vaults of the church, had
nearly raised a rebellion among his subjects. In <i>Render</i>'s tour
through Germany, an instance is given of the fatal effects of
burying in churches, the relation of which makes one shudder
with horror.</p>

<p>The bank of the river, being one of the enclosing fences to
the burying-ground, was ornamented with beautiful weeping
willows which, with a few solitary cypresses interspersed among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
the tombs, were the only trees that appeared in this part of the
country.</p>

<p>In a corner of the cemetery was a temple, built after the
usual plan, with an altar in the center; and a number of deities
moulded in clay were ranged on each side on stone pedestals.
We observed no priests; but an elderly lady was very busily
employed in throwing the sticks of fate, in order to obtain a
lucky number in which, however, she failed. During the
operation of shaking the cup, her countenance betrayed a greater
degree of eagerness and anxiety than usually appears on the
face of a Chinese; and she left the temple in a peevish and
muttering tone, sufficiently expressive of the greatness of her
disappointment which, it seemed, was no less than a refusal, on
the part of the oracle, to hold out the hope of her being blessed
with a second husband. Till this circumstance had been explained
to us by the keeper of the temple, it was concluded that
the old lady had been muttering imprecations against us for disturbing
her in the midst of her devotions.</p>

<p>After two days' sail from <i>Tien-sing</i> we arrived at a city of the
third order<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> called <i>Tchien-shien</i>. The surface of the interjacent
country had continued the same uniform plain, without a
pebble in the soil: the extent of cultivation by no means extraordinary;
and the few scattered villages of mean houses indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>no great degree of population; the dwellings that floated on the
water were numerous and crowded with inhabitants. We observed
several plots of young wheat rising in drills a few inches
above the ground. Buck-wheat was in full flower and several
plantations of the cotton plant, <i>gossypium herbaceum</i>, were in
pod, some of them perfectly ripe. Fahrenheit's thermometer on
the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month stood at 52° and 53°
in the morning, and about 70° in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>On the 17th, beside a great number of towns, villages and
military posts, which are regularly placed at intervals of about
three miles, we passed two cities of the third order, one of
which, from the length of its walls, appeared to be of very
considerable importance. No true idea, however, can be formed
of the population and magnitude of a Chinese city by the extent
of its enclosing walls. Few are without large patches of
unoccupied ground within them which, in many instances, far
exceeds the quantity of land that is built upon. Even in that
part of the capital called the Chinese city, several hundred acres
are under cultivation. The Imperial city, containing the
palace and buildings for the officers of state, the eunuchs and
artificers, occupies very nearly a square mile, more than two-thirds
of which is a kind of park and pleasure grounds; and
under the north wall of the Tartar city there is a pond or
swamp covered almost with the Nelumbium, which appeared to
be fully twice the dimensions of Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, or four
times their space, namely near fifty acres. Such spaces of
unoccupied ground might perhaps have been reserved for the
use of the inhabitants in case of siege, as the means of supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>ing
a few vegetables of the pungent kind, as onions and garlic, for
the besieged, which are the more necessary for a people who
use so small a portion of animal food, and little or no milk.
Thus the cities of Babylon and Nineveh, which were so frequently
exposed to the calamities of war and siege, had gardens
and corn-lands within their walls.</p>

<p>On the 18th we passed two cities and a great number of
towns and villages. The face of the country still level and entirely
open; not a hedge-row appearing on any side and very
few trees. Almost all the vessels that we met in the course
of the day were laden with sacks of cotton wool. This being
the night of full moon, we were allowed to enjoy very little
rest. The observance of the usual ceremonies, which consist
of firing their small petards, beating at intervals the noisy
gong, harsh squalling music and fire-works, required that
our vessels should remain stationary, and these nocturnal
orgies ceased only with the appearance of the sun. There
was, however, another cause of detention at this place. In
sailing against the stream of the <i>Eu-ho</i>, it was necessary the
barges should be tracked by men and these men were to be
pressed or forced into this laborious service from the villages
bordering upon the river. The usual way of doing this was
to send out the soldiers or attendants of the officers before the
vessels, in the dusk of the evening, to take the poor wretches
by surprize in their beds. But the ceremony of the full moon,
by retarding their usual hour of retiring to rest, had put them
on their guard; and, on the approach of the emissaries of government,
all that were liable to be pressed into this service had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
absconded, so that, in addition to the noise of the gongs and
the trumpets and crackers, our ears were frequently assailed by
the cries and lamentations of persons under the punishment of
the bamboo or the whip, for claiming their exemption from
joining the yachts and acting as trackers. When the groupe
that had been collected for this purpose was brought together
in the morning, it was impossible not to regard it with an
eye of pity. Most of them consisted of infirm and decrepit old
men, and the rest were such lank, sickly-looking, ill-clothed
creatures, that the whole groupe appeared to be much fitter for
an hospital than for performing any kind of labour. Our companions
pretended to say that every farmer, who rented lands
upon the public rivers or canals, was obliged, by the tenure on
which he held his lease, to furnish such a number of men to
track the vessels in the service of government whenever it might
be required; but that, on the present being an extraordinary
occasion, they had resolved to pay them, as they called it, in a
handsome manner, which was at the rate of something less than
seven-pence a day, without any allowance for returning to their
homes; a price for labour which bore no sort of proportion to
that of the necessaries of life; and it was even doubtful if this
pittance was ever paid to them.</p>

<p>Having cleared the fleet of shipping that was assembled at
this place, a favourable breeze relieved our invalids and
rendered their slender exertions unnecessary for the greater part
of the day, in the course of which we entered the province of
<i>Shan-tung</i>. In this province nothing worthy of notice occurred
until the 22d, when we quitted the <i>Eu-ho</i> and turning towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
the south entered the grand canal, out of which we observed
a gentle current flowing into the river. At this point of junction
the pagoda of <i>Lin-tsin</i>, an octagonal pyramid, was erected,
perhaps as a monument of this great and useful undertaking,
which, however, in its present state, apparently had not stood
many ages. In the hope of finding within it some inscription,
that might point out its designation, we mounted with some
difficulty upon the first of its nine stages or roofs (for the little
door on a level with the ground was walled up with bricks)
but it contained only the bare walls, not even a stair-case remained
nor any possible means of ascending to the top, and
the lower part was choaked up with rubbish. These pagodas
(or as the Chinese name them <i>Ta</i>) that so frequently occur in
the country, seem to be intended only as embellishments to
particular grounds, or objects to terminate villas or prospects.
Sometimes, it is true, they appear as appendages to temples, but
are never appropriated for the purposes of sacred worship.
Whatever their intention might have been, it would seem the
rage of building them no longer exists, not one of a late erection
having appeared in the whole country, and more than two-thirds
of those we saw being in ruins.</p>

<p>At the junction of the canal with the <i>Eu-ho</i> there was no
lock nor flood-gate; the gentle current of the former was interrupted
only from place to place, by loose planks let down
in grooves cut in stone piers. These dams seldom occasioned
the difference of a foot in the level of the water; and at each
was a guard-house with double the usual number of soldiers
stationed, to assist in drawing up or letting down the planks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
as occasion might require. The canal, which at the commencement
was from sixty to one hundred feet in width, was contracted
at such places by the stone piers of the flood-gates to
about thirty feet.</p>

<p>Towards the evening of the 23d, as we approached the city
<i>Tong-tchang-foo</i>, we were much amused with a military man&oelig;uvre,
which was evidently intended to astonish us. Under
the walls of this city about three hundred soldiers were drawn
out in a line, which, however, the darkness of the night had
rendered invisible. But just as we were coming to anchor,
each soldier, at the sound of the gong, produced from under his
cloak a splendid lantern with which he went through a regular
manual exercise. The following morning we observed, for
the first time, a few hillocks breaking the line of the horizon
to the eastward. The country appeared to be in a tolerable
state of cultivation; but the mode of tillage exhibited no extraordinary
degree of skill or of labour. Villages of considerable
extent were erected along the banks of the canal, at intervals
of about three miles from each other; and, in the gardens
contiguous to these, grew in abundance the tobacco
plant whose leaves were small, hairy, and viscous, and the
flowers of which were of a greenish yellow passing into a faint
rose colour at the edges of the petals. We observed also small
patches of hemp. A greater use is made of the seeds and leaflets
of this plant, as a substitute for or to mix with tobacco, than
of its fibres for cloth, a purpose to which it is as rarely converted
by the Chinese as by the Hindoos, being little esteemed
for those valuable uses to which, since its introduction into Eu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>rope,
it has been applied. The number of lateral branches,
which in a warm climate each stem throws out close above the
surface of the ground, breaks the length of fibre and renders it
unfit for those purposes for which, in the northern regions of
Europe, its tall branchless stem is so well adapted. The sow
thistle, a plant that occurs in almost every part of the world,
was nothing different here from its usual habit in Europe. We
observed also a species of <i>Chenopodium</i> and of <i>Artemisia</i> or wormwood;
abundance of the <i>Pe-tsai</i>, and other common culinary
vegetables. In the small flower gardens, without which we
scarcely observed a single cottage, were balsams, several kinds
of beautiful asters, holy-hocks, two species of <i>Malva</i>, an <i>Amaranthus</i>,
and the showy and handsome shrub the <i>Nerium Oleander</i>.</p>

<p>Having passed on the 26th October the walls of the city
<i>Tsie-ning</i>, where a multitude of small craft were lying at anchor,
we came to an extensive lake of the same name, navigated by
a great number of sailing boats. From the east side of this lake
the canal was separated only by an immense mound of earth.
To the westward the whole country, beyond the reach of sight,
was one continued swamp or morass, upon which were interspersed
pools or ponds of water abounding with the Nelumbium,
at this time in full flower. The morass being several
feet below the surface of the water in the canal afforded the
means of regulating the quantity; and, accordingly, at certain
distances, we observed stone arches turned in the earthen embankment
to let off the superfluous water that might be occasioned
by the swelling of the feeding rivers. About this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
also, it was remarked, that the bed of the canal was carried in a
line so nearly horizontal, that the water had a gentle current
either to the northward or the southward, according as these
sluices were kept shut or thrown open; this line being ascertained,
perhaps, rather by the surface of the lake than by the
assistance of instruments; for it was sufficiently remarkable, that
no opportunity had been omitted in carrying this great work
along the side, or through the middle, of lakes or other pools of
water wherever it could be done.</p>

<p>The nature of the country admitted of such management for
three days' journey, or about eighty miles from <i>Tsie-ning</i>. The
whole of this extensive plain consisted in lakes or swampy
ground half covered with water. On the former were constantly
seen moving about vessels with sails and boats of every description,
conveying an animated picture of activity, industry,
and commerce. Almost all the lakes were studded with islands
and these were covered with villages, that were chiefly inhabited
by fishermen. Here, for the first time, we observed the
<i>Leu-tzé</i> or fishing corvorant, the <i>Pelicanus Sinensis</i>, diving after
the finny tribe and seemingly no less anxious than its master
to take them. This bird is so like another species of the pelican,
called the <i>Carbo</i> or common corvorant which in England, as
naturalists inform us, was formerly trained for fishing, that it has
usually been considered the same, but from several specimens
brought home with us it appears to be a different species. The
usual practice is to take ten or twelve of these birds, in the
morning when fasting, upon a raft of bamboo poles lashed together,
and to let one or two at most at a time dive for fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
which are taken from them the moment they bring them to the
surface. These birds, not much larger than the common duck,
will seize and gripe fast fishes that are not less than their own
weight. When the proprietor judges the first pair to be pretty
well fatigued, they are suffered to feed by way of encouragement
on some of the fish they have taken, and a second pair
are dispatched upon the water. The fish we observed them to
take was a species of perch. In the course of three days' navigation,
we saw several thousand boats and rafts employed in this
kind of fishing.</p>

<p>Except on the water and the islands, the whole of the
swampy country might be said to be uninhabited and totally
void of any kind of cultivation. Sometimes, indeed, a few miserable
mud huts appeared on the small hillocks that here and
there raised their heads out of the dreary waste of morass; but
the chief inhabitants were cranes, herons, guillemots and a vast
variety of other kinds of birds that frequent the waters and
swamps. Here too are great numbers of that singular and beautiful
bird, the <i>Anas Galericulata</i>, usually known by the name
of the <i>Mandarin duck</i> which, like the gold and silver fishes,
is caught and reared as an article of sale to the opulent and curious.
The great extent of water had a sensible effect on the temperature
of the air, especially in the mornings and evenings,
when Fahrenheit's thermometer was sometimes below 40°.</p>

<p>Having passed the lakes and swamps, we entered suddenly,
on the 31st, upon a most delightful part of the country, crowded
with temples and villages and towns and cities, near all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
which, and on every part of the canal, were vast numbers of
the revenue vessels, collecting the surplus taxes paid in kind,
in order to transport them to the capital. Wheat and cotton appeared
to be the two principal articles of culture. The surface
of the country was now broken into hill and dale, every inch
appeared to be under tillage, except the summit of the knolls,
which were generally crowned with forest trees, and few of
the detached houses or temples were without extensive gardens
and orchards. Apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots
and pomgranates, were the common kinds of fruit, and the
culinary vegetables were the same as those of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>.
The canal at this place is, perhaps, the grandest inland navigation
in the whole world, being nearly a thousand feet in
width and bordered on each side by stone quays, built with
massy blocks of grey marble mixed with others of granite; and
this immense aqueduct, although forced up several feet above
the surface of the country by embankments thrown up by the
labour of man, flowed with a current of three miles an hour nearly
towards the Yellow River, to which we perceived we were
fast approaching, by the bustle and activity both on shore and
on the numberless canals that branched out in every direction
from the main trunk; on whose banks, for several miles on
either side, one continued town extended to the point of junction
with this large river, celebrated in every period of the
Chinese history. A village was particularly pointed out by the
bargemen, whose name was derived from a miracle, which is
most sacredly believed by the Chinese. Tradition says, that
the famous astronomer <i>Heu</i> was carried up to Heaven in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
house, which stood at this place, leaving behind him an old
faithful servant who, being thus deprived of his master and
his habitation, was reduced to beggary; but happening by accident
to throw a little prepared rice into the ground, it immediately
grew and produced grain without chaff for his sustenance;
from whence the place is called <i>Sen-mee</i>, <i>rice growing
ready dressed</i>, to this day.</p>

<p>Before our barges launched into the stream of the Yellow
River, which rolled in a very rapid torrent, certain ceremonies
were conceived to be indispensably necessary. In the
practical part of religion (which indeed may be considered as
nearly the whole) a Chinese is not less solicitous to avert a possible
evil, than to procure an eventual good; and of all evils
personal danger is most apprehended. It was therefore deemed
expedient, that an oblation should be made in every vessel
of the fleet to the genius of the river. The animals that were
sacrificed, on this occasion, were different in different yachts,
but they generally consisted of a fowl or a pig, two animals that
were very common in Grecian sacrifices. The blood, with the
feathers and the hair, was daubed upon the principal parts of
the vessel. On the forecastle of some were placed cups of wine,
oil and salt; in others, tea, flour and salt; and in others, oil,
rice and salt. The last article appears to be thought by the
Chinese, as well as by the Hebrews, a necessary accompaniment
to every sacrifice. "Every oblation of thy meat-offering
shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the
salt of the Covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy <i>meat</i>-offering."
As, however, the high priest and his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
were to feast on those parts of the meat-offering, which were
considered as unworthy the acceptance of heaven, which parts,
by the way, were always the best of the victim, one might,
perhaps, assign a reason for the strong injunction of offering salt,
this being a scarce article in many countries of the East and the
best preservative of meat against putrefaction<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>The cups, the slaughtered animal and several made-dishes
remained on the forecastle, the Captain standing over them on
one side and a man with a gong in his hand on the other. On
approaching the rapid part of the stream, at the signal given by
the gong, the Captain took up the cups one by one, in order
that, like the Greeks of old, he might "perform the rites and
pour the ruddy wine," which he did by throwing their contents
over the bow of the vessel into the river. The libation performed,
a quantity of crackers and squibs and gilt tin foil were
burnt, with uplifted hands, whilst the deep-sounding gong was
incessantly struck with increasing violence as the vessels were
swept along with the current. The victim and the other dishes
were then removed for the use of the Captain and crew, and
the ceremony ended by three genuflexions and as many
prostrations. The Emperor is never satisfied with less than
nine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p><p>Our fleet consisted of about thirty sail, and from each vessel
there proceeded, on its launching into the stream, such a din
of gongs and crackers and such volumes of smoke from the
burnt offerings, that the deity of the river must have been in a
very surly humour if he was not pleased with such a multitude
of oblations. The safe arrival, on the opposite bank, of the
whole squadron was a proof of his having accepted the homage,
and accordingly he was again addressed in a volley of
crackers as a token of thanks for his propitious and friendly
aid.</p>

<p>The width of the river at this place was full three quarters
of a mile; and the stream, where strongest, ran with the rapidity
of seven or eight miles an hour; and the water was as
thick and muddy as if the heaviest torrents of rain had just descended,
whereas, in fact, there had not fallen a shower for many
months.</p>

<p>The length of that part of the canal which lies between the
<i>Eu-ho</i> and the Yellow River, and which we had now sailed
over, is about two hundred English miles. The natural slope
of the country being from North to South, the projectors of
this work seem to have fixed upon the middle point, or nearly
so, between these two rivers for the commencement of their
operations: so that from this middle point to the northward,
or rising part of the country, they have been under the necessity,
in order to preserve their level, of cutting down to the
depth of thirty, forty, and even to seventy feet, below the surface;
whilst from the same point to the southward, or descending
part of the country, they have been obliged to force up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
water between immense banks of earth and stone, far above the
level of the flat surface; consisting almost entirely of lakes,
swamps, and morass. The quantity of human labour that must
have been employed, in amassing together the different materials
that compose this immense aqueduct, could not have been supplied,
in any reasonable length of time, except in a country
where millions could be set to work at the nod of a despot.
The greatest works in China have always been, and still continue
to be, performed by the accumulation of manual labour,
without the assistance of machinery, except on very particular
occasions, where some mechanical power may be absolutely
necessary to be brought in aid of human strength. Thus,
where canals are carried over surfaces that are too hilly and uneven
to admit of one continued level, they descend from place
to place, as it were by steps, at each of which is an inclined
plane; the height from the upper canal to the lower being
generally from six to ten feet; and the angle of the plane from
forty-five to fifty degrees. All vessels navigating such canals
must be hoisted up these planes by the assistance of upright capstans,
without which it would scarcely be possible to get those of
large demensions, together with their cargo, out of one canal into
the other; and they are gently lowered in the same manner.
This awkward contrivance may, perhaps, less imply the ignorance
of locks or other methods practised elsewhere, than the
unwillingness of the government to suffer any innovation that
might be the means of depriving many thousands of obtaining
that scanty subsistence, which they now derive from their attendance
at these capstans. However slightly such a notion may
be held in Europe, there can be no doubt that a general intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>duction
of machinery into China, for the purpose of facilitating
and expediting labour would, in the present state of the country,
be attended with the most pernicious and distressing consequences;
were it only for this simple reason that, despising, as
they affect to do, all foreign commerce, the demand for the
products of machinery, however much they might be reduced
in price, would not be encreased, whilst that of manual labour
would considerably be diminished.</p>

<p>Sensible as the Chinese seem to be of the advantages derived
from an easy communication between the different parts of the
empire, by means of canals, it is the more surprizing what the
motives could have been that, till this moment, have restrained
them from facilitating an intercourse by means of good roads,
in such parts of the country as have no inland navigations. In
this respect they fall short of most civilized nations. Except
near the capital, and in some few places where the junction of
the grand canal with navigable rivers is interrupted by mountainous
ground, there is scarcely a road in the whole country
that can be ranked beyond a foot-path. Hence it happens that
in the northern provinces, during winter, it is impossible to
travel with any degree of ease, convenience, or safety; all the
canals to the northward of the Yellow River, which runs from
34° to 35° latitude being frozen up. It is equally surprizing
that their ingenuity has not extended itself to the invention of
sledges or some sort of carriages suitable for travelling on ice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
which other nations have converted into the best of roads<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>The continuation of the Grand Canal, from the Yellow
River to the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i>, was constructed upon the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
principles as that part between the Yellow River and the <i>Eu-ho</i>.
The country being level and abounding with lakes and marshy
grounds, it was carried upon a mound of earth kept together by
retaining walls of stone the whole distance, which is about ninety
miles, being in parts not less than twenty feet above the general
level of the country; and the sheet of water it contained was
two hundred feet in width, running sometimes at the rate of
three miles an hour. Canals of communication supplied it from
the westward; and the superfluous water was let off upon the
low marshes. The tops of the walls of <i>Pao-yng-shien</i> were
just on a level with the surface of the water in the canal, so
that if the bank opposite to it were to burst, the whole city must
inevitably be inundated. Very little cultivation appeared in this
low marshy country, but abundance of towns and villages, the
inhabitants of which subsisted by fishing. A prodigious extent
of low country on each side of the Yellow River, perhaps not
much less than the surface of all England, is liable to inundations.
The Chinese say, the overflowing of this river has been
more fatal to the country than war, pestilence, or famine. The
Emperor <i>Kaung-shee</i>, in order to distress a rebel in the province
of <i>Honan</i>, ordered a bank to be broken down behind a city he
had got possession of; but the inundation was so great, that not
only the rebel forces were destroyed, but almost half a million
of people were completely swept away; and among these were
several European missionaries. Vast sums of money are expended
in confining this river within its banks. The same Emperor
in his last will declares, that the sums of money issued
annually from the Imperial treasury for the embankments to
prevent inundations, were never less, during his whole reign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
than 3,000,000 ounces of silver, equivalent to one million
sterling.</p>

<p>On approaching the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i> the appearance of the
country improved, just as it had done in the vicinity of the Yellow
River. The town of <i>Sau-poo</i>, extending along the quay of
the canal, consisted of houses that were generally two stories
high, apparently well built, white-washed with lime and kept
in neat and clean order. The inhabitants were also better
cloathed than we had hitherto been accustomed to see them. The
women were less shy in their advances; their complexions were
much fairer and their features more soft and handsome than any
we had yet observed in the northern provinces.</p>

<p>The walls and gates of <i>Yang-tchoo-foo</i> bore marks of great
antiquity, being partly in ruins and almost entirely overgrown
with moss and creeping plants. A thousand vessels, at least, of
different descriptions were lying under its walls. Here we remained
for the night; and the following morning, being the
5th of November, we launched into the grand and beautiful river
called the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i>, which at this place was about two
miles in width; but the current was so gentle, that no oblation
to the presiding deity was thought to be necessary. The numerous
islands rising out of the river and covered with verdure,
the multitude of ships of war, of burden and of pleasure, some
gliding down the stream, others sailing against it; some moving
by oars and others lying at anchor; the banks on either
side covered with towns and houses, as far as the eye could
reach, presented a prospect more varied and cheerful than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
that had hitherto occurred. Nor was the canal, on the opposite
side, less lively; for two whole days we were continually passing
among fleets of vessels of different constructions and dimensions,
those belonging to the revenue department being the largest, each
capable of carrying, at least, two hundred tons. Cities, towns
and villages were continued along the banks without intermission:
and vast numbers of stone bridges were thrown across the
canal, some having one, some two, and others three arches.
The face of the country was beautifully diversified with hill and
dale and every part of it in the highest state of cultivation.
The chief produce was that particular species of cotton, of a
yellowish tinge, known in Europe by the name of nankin.</p>

<p>The suburbs of <i>Sou-tchoo-foo</i> employed us full three hours in
passing before we reached the walls of the city, where a multitude
of vessels were lying at anchor. The numerous inhabitants
that appeared upon and without the walls of this extensive
city, were better dressed and seemed to be more contented
and cheerful, than we had yet observed them in any other place.
For the most part they were cloathed in silk. The ladies were
here dressed in petticoats and not in trowsers, as they had
hitherto appeared to the northward. The general fashion of
the head-dress was a black satin cap with a triangular peak, the
point descending to the root of the nose, in the middle of
which, or about the centre of the forehead, was a crystal button.
The whole face and neck were washed with a preparation
of white lead and the cheeks highly rouged; and two vermillion
spots, like wafers, were particularly conspicuous, one
on the centre of the under lip and the other on the chin. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
feet were universally squeezed down to an unnatural size. Few
females were seen among the immense crowds that the novelty
of the sight had brought together, but great numbers had assembled
in the houses and particularly on board the pleasure or
passage yachts, with the intention of satisfying their curiosity.
The superior style of dress and the appearance of the women
in public at this place, so different from the general custom of
the country, could only be explained to us by the writings of
the Christian missionaries, who observe that the concubines of
mandarins and men of property are chiefly procured from the
cities of <i>Yang-tchoo</i> and of <i>Sou-tchoo</i>, where they are educated
in the pleasing arts of singing, music and dancing and every
other accomplishment suitable to women of superior rank, in
order to render them the more agreeable and fascinating. That
such women are generally purchased by persons engaged in
the trade, in different parts of the country, and trained in these
cities, where they are disposed of to the highest bidder, "<i>this
being the principal branch of trade that is carried on in those
two cities</i>." How do these holy men reconcile so infamous a
traffic among a people whom they have adorned with every
virtue? a people whom they have rendered remarkable among
nations for their filial piety! Is there on earth a crime
more revolting against civilized nature, or more detestable to
civilized society, than that of a parent selling his own child and
consigning her, expressly and voluntarily, into a state of prostitution?
Those unfortunate wretches who, in Europe, have by
any accident reduced themselves to that degraded and deplorable
condition of becoming subservient to the pleasures of a
man, whom they probably detest, are generally the objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
pity, however their conduct may be disapproved; but a parent,
who should be the cause of reducing them to such a state, would
be execrated; but the assertion is as absurd as ridiculous, and
the writer must have been very credulous to suppose, that the
<i>principal trade</i> of one of the largest cities in the world, whose
population cannot be less than a million of souls, should consist
in buying and selling ladies of pleasure. Buying females in
the legal way is certainly the greatest branch of trade throughout
China, as every woman there is bought and sold. These reverend
gentlemen likewise inform us, with great indifference,
that if a man be desirous of having a male child and his wife
should happen to be barren, he will purchase one of these concubines
for the sole purpose of getting an heir; and, when this
is accomplished, he either provides her with a husband, or
turns her adrift. Such are the moral virtues of the Chinese,
compared with whom all other nations have been accounted
barbarous<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>To the west of <i>Sau-tchoo-foo</i> is a range of mountains higher
than any we had yet seen, well covered with wood; and an
extensive lake stretches along their base, famed in China for
its picturesque beauties and for its fish. We would gladly
have made a party of pleasure to this delightful spot, but innumerable
objections, as usual, were started by our conductors,
on the score of delay that such an excursion would occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p><p>The two great products of this part of the country are rice
and silk; the former of which, at this time, they were busily
employed in reaping. Plantations of the mulberry tree were
extended on both sides of the canal and into the country beyond
the reach of sight. They appeared to be of two distinct
species; the one, the common mulberry, <i>morus nigra</i>, and the
other having much smaller leaves, smooth and heart-shaped,
and bearing a white berry about the size of the field strawberry.
The latter had more the habit of a shrub, but the branches of
neither were suffered to run into strong wood, being frequently
pruned in order that the trunk might annually throw out
young scions, whose leaves were considered to be more tender
than such as grew from old branches. Another reason was also
assigned for this operation. A tree, when left to itself, throws
out the greatest part of its leaves at once, in the spring of the
year, but if the thick wood be cut out from time to time, new
leaves will continue to push below the parts so cut off during
the whole season; and, accordingly, the Chinese are particularly
attentive to prune afresh in the autumn, in order to obtain a
supply of young leaves in the after spring. The thermometer
at this place, on the 9th of November at sun-rise, stood at 64°,
and at noon in the shade at 70° degrees.</p>

<p>It was in this part of the canal where the bridge of ninety-one
arches, mentioned in the sixth chapter, was thrown across the
arm of a lake that joined the canal. I lament exceedingly that
we passed this extraordinary fabric in the night. It happened to
catch the attention of a Swiss servant who, as the yacht glided
along, began to count the arches, but finding them increase in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
number much beyond his expectation and, at the same time,
in dimensions, he ran into the cabin calling out with great
eagerness, "For God's sake, gentlemen, come upon deck, for
here is a bridge such as I never saw before; it has no
end." Mr. Maxwell and I hastened upon deck and, by the
faint light, could sufficiently distinguish the arches of a bridge
running parallel with the eastern bank of the canal, across the
arm of a vast lake, with which the navigation thus communicated.
From the highest point, or what appeared to us to be
the central arch, I counted forty-five to the end; here they
were very small, but the central arch I guessed to be about thirty
feet high and forty wide; and the whole length of the bridge
I calculated to be about half a mile. The construction of such
a bridge, in such a situation, could obviously have been employed
for no other purpose than that of opening a free communication
with the lake; and, at the same time, of avoiding the
labour and expence of accumulating materials sufficient for making
a solid embankment.</p>

<p>After sailing a great part of the day through a forest of mulberry
trees, planted with much regularity, we arrived on the
10th at the city of <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>, the capital of the province
of <i>Tche-kiang</i>. Here that branch of the grand canal which communicates
with the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i> terminates in a large commodious
bason, at this time crowded with shipping. From this
bason a number of smaller canals, passing through arches
turned in the walls and intersecting the city in every direction,
are finally united in a lake beyond the western wall called the
<i>See-hoo</i>. The natural and artificial beauties of this lake far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
exceeded any thing we had hitherto had an opportunity of seeing
in China. The mountains surrounding it were lofty and
broken into a variety of forms that were highly picturesque;
and the vallies were richly cloathed with trees of different kinds,
among which three species were remarkably striking, not only
by their intrinsic beauty, but also by the contrast they formed
with themselves and the rest of the trees of the forest. These
were the <i>Laurus Camphora</i> or camphor tree, the <i>Croton sebiferum</i>
or tallow tree, and the <i>Thuia Orientalis</i> or arbor vitæ.
The bright shining green foliage of the first, mingled with the
purple leaves of the second, and overtopped by the tall and
stately <i>tree of life</i>, of the deepest green, produced a pleasing
effect to the eye; and the landscape was rendered still more interesting
to the mind, by the very singular and diversified appearance
of several repositories of the dead, upon the sloping
sides of the inferior hills. Here, as well as elsewhere, the sombre
and upright cypress was destined to be the melancholy
companion of the tombs. Higher still among the woods,
avenues had been opened to admit of rows of small blue houses,
supported on white colonnades which, on examination, were
also found to be mansions of the dead. Naked coffins of extraordinary
thickness were every where lying upon the surface of
the ground.</p>

<p>The lake that extended from the walls of the city to the feet
of the mountains, and threw its numerous arms into the wooded
vallies, was the seat of pleasure, as well as of profit, to the inhabitants
of <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>. These amusements, however, of
floating upon barges in the lake are principally confined to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
sex. Few women, except those of loose character, join in the
parties of men. How miserable or, at best, how little interest
can be raised in that state of society where no social intercourse
of the sexes exists; where sentiment, nice feeling and the sport
and play of the softer passions are totally unknown, and where
reason and philosophy are at so low an ebb! In more enlightened
countries, when age may have weakened the ardour of
joining in the sprightly female circle, or inclination lead to
more serious conversations, numberless resources are still left
to exercise the faculties of the mind, and society may always
be had for such as can relish</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"The feast of reason and the flow of soul."<br />
</div></div>

<p>But in China the tenor of their conversation must be always
nearly the same, turning chiefly on the affairs of the neighbourhood,
the injustice of the magistrates, the tricks and stratagems
of the crafty merchant, or of the low mechanic. In
entertainments given by those who can afford to drink wine, it
is seldom served round as in other countries, but a number of
puerile contrivances are practised to determine which of the
party is to drink, as in the case I have already noticed of <i>the
game of the fingers</i>. Thus, a nosegay is passed round from
hand to hand, whilst a man in an adjoining room beats a drum
or the gong, and he who happens to hold the nosegay when
the instrument ceases must drink a cup of wine. Many other
methods still more childish are resorted to, in order to pass
the time and to give a zest to their wine; but the usual resource
here, as well as elsewhere, against the tediousness of time, is
gaming. An attachment to this vice accompanies the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
Chinese wherever he goes. It is said that in one of our eastern
colonies, where Chinese are encouraged to settle, they pay to
the government the annual sum of ten thousand dollars for a
licence to keep gaming tables and sell opium.</p>

<p>Our route being necessarily delayed for two days at this place,
on account of an intervening neck of land over which all the
baggage was to be transported, I prevailed upon our good natured
companion <i>Van-ta-gin</i> to make a party to the lake <i>See-hoo</i>,
to which he readily assented; and this was the only excursion
that we had in the course of the whole journey. We
had a splendid yacht and another made fast to it to serve as a
kitchen; the dinner began the instant we went on board and
ceased only when we stepped a-shore. It consisted of at least a
hundred dishes in succession, among which were excellent eels,
fresh caught in the lake and dressed in a variety of ways; yet
the water was clear as crystal. Vast numbers of barges were sailing
to and fro, all gaily decorated with paint and gilding and
streaming colours; the parties within them apparently all in
pursuit of pleasure. The margins of the lake were studded
with light aereal buildings, among which one of more solidity
and of greater extent than the rest was said to belong to the
Emperor. The grounds were enclosed with brick walls and
mostly planted with vegetables and fruit trees; but in some
there appeared to be collections of such shrubs and flowers as are
most esteemed in the country. Among the fruits we got at this
place was the <i>Jambo</i> or rose apple; and, for the first time, fresh
from the tree, but not yet perfectly ripe, two species of oranges,
the common China and the small one usually called the Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>darin
orange; pomgranates, bananas very indifferent and
melons equally bad; apricots far from being equal to those of
our own country; a large plumb, resembling the egg plumb,
also indifferent, and peaches that might have been much improved
by judicious culture; apples and pears that in England
we should have no hesitation in pronouncing execrably bad;
and a species of fruit unknown to all of us which the Chinese
called <i>Zee-tsé</i>, of a sweet sickly taste when ripe, otherwise most
insufferably astringent. Some of the gentlemen thought they
saw hazel nuts among the shruberry, but it is more than probable
they were mistaken. A few bad grapes were sometimes
brought to us, but the party who went from hence to <i>Chu-san</i>
met with abundance of this fruit, and of very good quality,
growing upon standards erected in the several canals and forming
a shade under which the barges could pass.</p>

<p>Among the most conspicuous of the shrubs, on the borders of
the lake <i>See-hoo</i>, was the <i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>, the <i>Hibiscus Syriacus</i>,
the <i>Syringa Vulgaris</i> or common lilac, and the paper mulberry;
we observed also a species of <i>Mimosa</i>, a <i>Crotularia</i>, <i>Cratægus</i>,
<i>Rosa</i>, <i>Rhamnus</i>, <i>Sambucus</i>, <i>Juniper</i> and the cotton plant. Of
flowers we particularly noticed a large purple-coloured double
poppy which, with the <i>Nelumbium</i> that grew here in all the
ponds and a species of <i>pæonia</i>, appear most frequently on the
large sheets of painted paper used for covering the walls of their
apartments. A great variety of beautiful balsams were also
in flower, a species of <i>Amaranthus</i>, a <i>Xeranthemum</i> and <i>Gnaphalium</i>.
I mention only such plants as caught the eye in passing,
for our Chinese companions, who had a much better appetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
for the eels of the lake and other goods things they had taken
care to provide than for botany, had no notion of being detained
by a bush or a flower.</p>

<p>The next day Lieutenant Colonel, now General, Benson,
Doctor Gillan, and myself, accompanied by a military officer
and his orderly, rode over the neck of land to look at the
yachts that were preparing for our future journey. As it was rather
late before we returned, I proposed that we should pass through
the city as I had done the day before with our conductor <i>Van</i>,
which would save us half the distance. The officer perceiving
our intention endeavoured to draw us off to the right, but finding
us persevere he whispered the orderly, who immediately
pushed forward towards the gate. Aware that the intention
of this measure was to shut the gate against us, we spurred our
horses and followed him, upon which the officer and his orderly
set up such a hue and cry that the whole suburbs were presently
in a state of commotion. The gates were instantly shut and
surrounded by a crowd. Within all was confusion. Message after
message was dispatched to the Governor, the gongs were beat
and the guards were drawn out in every part of the city. I
assured them there was nothing to fear; that we were only
three, and had no other design but to pass to our yachts.
During this time our <i>mandarin of war</i>, in presence of the whole
populace, was down on his knees in the dirt, first before one
and then another, intreating us to give up the point; so mean
and despicable have the maxims of the government made these
people. At length our friends <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i>, with the interpreter
and a numerous train of soldiers and attendants, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
their appearance, and pretended to enjoy the joke of three
Englishmen having caused so much alarm to one of their strongest
cities, which at that time had a garrison of three thousand men
within its walls. On expressing our surprise at such unnecessary
precaution, <i>Van</i> observed, that our conductor did not know
us so well as he did, and, as he was responsible for our safe return,
he would rather have travelled us all night through the
country than brought us among the crowd in the streets.
When the new viceroy of Canton (who travelled with us from
hence) heard of this affair, and understood from our conductors
that the English found great pleasure in walking and looking
about them (a pleasure of which a Chinese can form no idea)
he immediately gave orders that the gentlemen in the train of
the Embassador should walk whenever they pleased without any
molestation.</p>

<p>In the city of <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>, being particularly famed for its
silk-trade, we were not surprized to meet with extensive shops
and warehouses; in point of size and the stock contained within
them they might be said to vie with the best in London. In
some of these were not fewer than ten or twelve persons serving
behind the counter; but in passing through the whole city not
a single woman was visible, either within doors or without.
The crowd of people, composed of the other sex, appeared to
be little inferior to that in the great streets of Pekin. Here,
though mostly narrow they had in other respects much the advantage
of those in the capital, being paved with broad flagstones,
resembling the Merceria of Venice or courts of the
Strand; Cranburn-Alley is rather too wide for a Chinese street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
but those of this city were equally well paved. They appeared to
be kept extremely neat and clean. In every shop were exposed to
view silks of different manufactures, dyed cottons and nankins, a
great variety of English broad-cloths, chiefly however blue
and scarlet, used for winter cloaks, for chair covers and for
carpets; and also a quantity of peltry intended for the northern
markets. The rest of the houses, in the public streets through
which we passed, consisted of butchers and bakers' shops, fishmongers,
dealers in rice and other grain, ivory-cutters, dealers
in laquered ware, tea-houses, cook-shops, and coffin makers;
the last of which is a trade of no small note in China. The
population of the city alone, I should suppose, from its extent
and appearance, to be not much inferior to that of Pekin; and
the number of inhabitants in the suburbs, with those that
constantly resided upon the water, were perhaps nearly equal
to those within the walls.</p>

<p>Here our conductor <i>Sun-ta-gin</i> took his leave, after having
introduced to the Embassador the new Viceroy of Canton, who
was now to accompany the Embassy to the seat of his government.
His manners appeared to be no less amiable than those
of the Minister. He had travelled post from Pekin and,
with many assurances on the part of the Emperor of the
highest satisfaction he had derived from the embassy, he brought
an additional present from him to His Majesty, consisting of
gold tissued silks, purses taken from his own person and the
<i>Card of Happiness</i>. This is an ornamented piece of paper,
neatly folded up and having in the centre the character <i>foo</i> or
happiness inscribed by the Emperor's own hand, and is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
as the strongest mark a sovereign of China can give to another
prince of his friendship and affection. Another card was given
to the Embassador of a similar import, as a testimony of his
approbation of the conduct of the embassy, which was further
confirmed by a present of silks, tea, fans and other trinkets to
every individual of it.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond the city we again took shipping on
the river <i>Tcheng-tang-chiang</i>, which might properly be called
an estuary, the tide rising and falling six or seven feet at the
place of embarkation, which was not very distant from the
Yellow Sea. After seven days of tedious navigation, if dragging
by main strength over a pebbly bottom on which the boats
were constantly aground and against a rapid stream, could be
so called, we came to its source near the city of <i>Tchang-san-shien</i>.
But its banks were not deficient in beautiful views and
picturesque scenery. The general surface of the country was
mountainous and romantic, but well cultivated in all such places
as would admit the labours of the husbandman. One city only
occurred in the course of seven days; but we passed numerous
villages, situated in the valleys and the glens between the ridges
of mountains; and fishermen's huts were constantly in view.
There was here no want of trees, among which the most common
were the tallow-tree and the camphor, cedars, firs and the
tall and majestic arbor vitæ. Groves of oranges, citrons and
lemons were abundantly interspersed in the little vales that
sloped down to the brink of the river; and few of the huts
were without a small garden and plantation of tobacco. The
larger plains were planted with the sugar-cane. We had thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
far passed through the country without having seen a single
plant of the tea-shrub, but here we found it used as a common
plant for hedge-rows to divide the gardens and fruit
groves, but not particularly cultivated for its leaves.</p>

<p>At the city of <i>Tchang-san-shien</i> we had again a neck of land
to cross, in order to join the barges that were prepared on another
river falling towards the westward, by which a connexion
was formed with the usual route from Pekin to Canton, from
whence we had deviated at the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i> river, on account
of some of the suite being intended to join the Hindostan in the
harbour of <i>Tchu-san</i>. We were the less sorry for this deviation,
as it gave us an opportunity of seeing a part of the country over
which there is no general communication with the grand route.
In passing this neck of land, on a very fine causeway, judiciously
led through the defiles of the mountains, we first observed
the terrace system of agriculture, so frequently mentioned in the
writings of the missionaries. The Chinese seem to entertain
a particular aversion against sowing or planting on sloping
ground and, accordingly, when such occurs, they level it into
a number of terraces one rising above the other, which they
support by stone walls, if the earth should not be thought sufficiently
strong for the purpose. The great conveniency of
leading the water from the uppermost to the lowest terrace,
without losing any of its nutritive effects by a rapid course,
seems to have suggested this mode of preparing the ground.
In a hot and dry country, vegetation becomes languid without
the command of water; and I observed that on the uppermost
terrace there was invariably a tank or reservoir to collect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
waters falling from the upper parts of the hills. The expense
of labour, that had evidently been employed on such terraces,
was so great as to make any suitable return to the husbandman
apparently impossible; and still less so in other places where the
hills were completely dug away to the skeleton rocks, and the
soil carried upon the marshy ground at their feet.</p>

<p>With all this industry it might be concluded, from the general
appearance of the people, that they merely gained a subsistence.
It was with the utmost difficulty that the officers of
government could procure, in the whole city which we last
departed from, a sufficient number of chairs for themselves and
those gentlemen of the embassy who preferred to be thus carried,
and horses for the rest. For the soldiers, indeed, that
composed his Excellency's guard, they had prepared a sort
of open bamboo chair, fixed between two poles and meant to
be carried shoulder-height. But the soldiers, squeezed into
these little chairs and elevated in the air, with their feathers
and their firelocks, soon perceived that they cut such ridiculous
figures and that the soon wretches who carried them were in
so miserable a condition, both with regard to their clothing and
their habit of body, that, ashamed to be thus dragged along,
they presently dismounted and insisted, in their turn, upon
carrying the Chinese. Our conductors affected to consider this
as a good joke, but others were evidently nettled at it, supposing
it might have been meant as a kind of oblique reflection
on the indifferent accommodations that had been provided at
this place for the Embassador and his retinue; which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
however the best that it was possible for them to procure by any
exertions.</p>

<p>Having finished this land journey, of about twenty-four
miles, in the course of the day, we lodged at <i>Eu-shan-shien</i>, a
small city of mean appearance and the following day embarked
on flat-bottomed barges, remarkably long and narrow, on the
river <i>Long shia-tong</i>; but two complete days of heavy rain
obliged us to remain quietly at anchor.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November we dropped down the river, which
by the rains was swelled to an enormous size and in some
places had overflowed its banks, though in general high and
rocky composed of a deep brown-coloured freestone. Several
rice mills were so completely inundated, that their thatched
roofs were but just visible above the surface of the water;
others were entirely washed away; and the wrecks of them
scattered upon the banks of the river. A vessel of our squadron
was upset upon the roof of one of these mills.</p>

<p>During two days' sail the surface of the country was hilly
and well wooded with camphors, firs, and tallow-trees; but as
we approached the <i>Po-yang</i> lake, a small inland sea, it began
to assume the uniform appearance of an extended marsh, without
any visible signs of cultivation: here and there a few small
huts, standing on the brink of pools of water, with twice the
number of small boats floating or drawn up on shore, sufficiently
indicated the occupation of the inhabitants. In this part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
country we had an opportunity of seeing the various means
practised by the Chinese to catch fish: rafts and other floating
vessels with the fishing corvorant: boats with moveable planks
turning on hinges, and painted so as to deceive fishes on moonlight
nights and entice them to leap out of the water upon the
planks; nets set in every form; and wicker baskets made exactly
in the same manner as those used in Europe. Large
gourds and blocks of wood were floating on the water, in order
to familiarize the various kinds of water-fowl to such objects,
which gave the Chinese an opportunity, by sticking their heads
into gourds or earthen pots and keeping their bodies under
water, to approach the birds in a gentle manner sufficiently
near to take them by the legs and draw them quietly under
the water; a method which is said to be practised by the natives
of South America.</p>

<p>The nearer we approached the great lake <i>Po-yang</i>, the more
dreary was the appearance of the country; and for the distance
of ten miles around it, or at least on the south and west sides,
was a wild waste of reeds and rank grasses, such as the <i>Scirpus</i>,
<i>Cyperus</i>, and bulrushes, interrupted only by stagnant pools of
water. Not a human dwelling of any description was to be
seen. This place may justly be considered as the sink of China,
into which rivers fall from every point of the compass. It is
scarcely possible for the imagination to form to itself an idea of
a more desolate region than that which surrounds the Po-yang
lake. The temperature was so reduced, by the circumambient
waters, that on the 27th November, with drizzling showers,
the thermometer was down to 48° in the forenoon. We sailed
near four whole days over the same kind of country and came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
towards the evening of the last, to the city of <i>Nan-tchang-foo</i>,
the capital of <i>Kiang-see</i>, where we observed from four to five
hundred of the revenue vessels lying at anchor. We waited at
this place a few hours to take in the necessary provisions and
to receive a present of silk, tea, and some other trifles from the
viceroy. We were told of a famous temple in the neighbourhood
of the city, but we had no curiosity to go out of the way
to see it, which was dedicated to the man who, as we have already
observed, made his <i>apotheosis</i> comfortably in his own
house; that there was a well belonging to this temple full of
large snakes, whom the priests venerate and to whom they admonish
the people to make sacrifices, as being children of the
dragons which, if not constantly appeased by oblations to
these their offspring, would destroy the whole world. Thus, in
all countries where votaries of superstition are to be found,
will knaves be met with to take advantage of their weakness.
The priests of this temple are said to have made one observation,
which is perhaps no superstition, that when these water
snakes appear on the surface, rains and inundations are sure to
follow. I took advantage, however, of the short delay, to go
on board one of the revenue vessels and to measure the capacity
of its hold. It was in length 115 feet, breadth 15 feet, and
depth 6 feet; the sides streight and the width nearly the
same fore and aft; so that the burden might fairly be estimated
at 250 tons. Independent, therefore, of the innumerable small
craft, there were lying before this city 100,000 tons of shipping.</p>

<p>The city of <i>Nan-tchang-foo</i> is situated upon the left bank of
the river <i>Kan-kiang-ho</i> falling from the southward into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
<i>Po-yang</i> lake. It was here about five hundred yards in width,
against the stream of which we made a rapid progress with a
brisk breeze. For the first sixty miles the country was flat and
uncultivated, except in places where we observed a few fields
of rice. But there was no want of population. Towns and
villages were constantly in sight, as were also manufactories of
earthen ware, bricks and tiles. The farther we advanced up
the river, the more populous was the country, the more varied
and agreeable the surface, and the more extended the cultivation.
The banks were skirted with large trees, that cast a cool
and comfortable shade on the walks beneath. Of these, some
were willows, others camphors, but by far the greatest number
were the <i>Yang-tchoo</i>, a large spreading tree that threw its
branches down to the ground where, like the <i>Ficus Indicus</i>, of
which indeed it was a variety, they took root and became
stems.</p>

<p>At the city <i>Kei-shui-shien</i>, which like most cities in China
offered little worthy of remark, the river divided into two
branches; and at <i>Kin-gan-foo</i>, a city of the first order, which
we passed the same night, by the river contracting suddenly the
current became stronger and of course our progress slower.
To track the barges it was necessary again to press a number
of men; here, however, it may be observed, they undertook
the service with more willingness than to the northward. The
river meandered through a mountainous and barren country,
rich only in picturesque beauty which, though pleasing to the
eye of the artist and the connoisseur, has less charms for the
philosopher, who finds more real beauties to exist in a soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
however tame and uniform, that can be rendered subservient to
the uses of man.</p>

<p>On the 3d of November we approached that part of the river
which, on account of the numerous ship-wrecks that have happened
there, is held in no small degree of dread by the Chinese.
They call it the <i>Shee-pa-tan</i>, or the eighteen cataracts: which
are torrents formed by ledges of rock running across the bed of
the river. They have not, however, any thing very terrific in
them, not one being half so dangerous as the fall at London
bridge about half-tide. But the Chinese have no great dexterity
in the management of their vessels. They are so easily
alarmed, that they frequently miscarry through timidity, when
a little recollection and resolution would have secured them
success. The mountains between which the river was hemmed
in were covered with forests of the larch fir; the glens and
vallies abounded with the bamboo, of which we here observed
two species, one the same that is common in other parts of the
East, and the second much smaller in its growth, seldom exceeding
the height of ten feet; and the fibres of its small stem are
more hard and solid than those of the other species. The Chinese
use it in the finer parts of such household furniture and
other articles as are constructed of bamboo. From the margins
of the river to the feet of the forests the lower parts of the
mountains were covered with coppice, among which the most
common shrub bore a close resemblance to the tea plant, and
accordingly the Chinese called it the <i>Tcha-wha</i>, or flower of
tea. It was the <i>Camellia Sesanqua</i> of Thunberg, to which they
had given the same name (not being very nice in specific distinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>tions),
as to the <i>Camellia Japonica</i> of Linnæus. From the nut
of the former not unlike to, though somewhat smaller than, the
chesnut, a very pleasant oil is expressed and used for similar purposes
to the Florence oil in Europe.</p>

<p>This intricate part of the river, where innumerable pointed
rocks occurred, some above, some even with, and others just
below the surface of the water, required two long days' sail with
a fair breeze; and the falls became more rapid and dangerous
the farther we advanced. At the fifteenth cataract we perceived
two or three vessels lying against the rocks with their
flat-bottoms uppermost; a terrible sight for our bargemen who,
like the countryman in the fable, instead of applying the shoulder
to the wheel, began to implore the assistance of the river
god by sounding the gong, in order to rouse his attention
and by regaling his olfactory nerves with the smoke of sandal-wood
matches; so that had we been dropping down the stream,
instead of going against it, there was every reason to apprehend
that our barge would have shared a similar fate; for it received
many a gentle rub against the rocks.</p>

<p>The appearance of the country in the neighbourhood of the
cataracts was extremely beautiful. The transparency of the
stream, the bold rocks finely fringed with wood, and the varied
forms of the mountains called to mind those delightful streams
that are discharged from the lakes of the northern counties of
England. Like these too, the <i>Kan-kiang-ho</i> abounded with
fish, not however with the delicious trout but one of much
less flavour, a species of perch. Great numbers of rafts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
floating on the river with the fishing corvorant, and we observed
that he seldom dived without success. For the whole distance
of three days' journey, the hilly country bordering on the
river produced very little but the <i>Camellia Sesanqua</i>, which appeared
to be every where of spontaneous growth.</p>

<p>We halted on the 6th of December, late in the evening, before
the city of <i>Kan-tchoo-foo</i>, which is remarkable for nothing
that I could learn except for the great quantity of varnish trees
the <i>Rhus vernix</i> I suppose, that are cultivated in the neighbourhood.
In the course of the journey we had picked up two
varieties of the tea plant, taken out of the ground and potted
by our own gardener; and which, being in good growing order,
were intended to be sent to Bengal as soon as occasion
might serve after our arrival at Canton. Knowing we should
be hurried away, as usual, in the morning and wishing to procure
a few young plants of the varnish tree, I prevailed on our
good friend <i>Van-ta-gin</i> to dispatch some person for that purpose,
to add to those of the tea plant and the <i>Camellia Sensanqua</i>.
<i>Van</i> made application to the men in office at this place,
with the best intention of serving us, but these gentry, either
conceiving that their compliance might be treason to the state,
or else, in the true spirit of the nation, determined to play a
trick upon the strangers, certainly procured the plants and
sent them on board in pots, just as we were departing the next
morning. In a short time they all began to droop, the leaves
withered and, on examination, it was found that not a single
plant among them had the least portion of a root, being nothing
more than small branches of trees which, from the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
of the wood, were not likely nor indeed ever intended to
strike root.</p>

<p>From <i>Kan-tchoo-foo</i> the face of the country became more uniform
and suitable for the labours of agriculture; and, accordingly,
we found a very small portion of it unoccupied. Wheat
about six inches above ground and extensive plantations of the sugar
cane fit for cutting, were the chief articles under cultivation:
and the farther we advanced to the southward, the more abundant
and extended were those of the latter. The canes were remarkably
juicy and their joints from six to nine inches in length. To
express the juice from them and convert it into a consistent
mass, temporary mills were erected in different places among
the plantations. The process was very simple. A pair of cylinders,
sometimes of stone but more generally of hard wood,
placed vertically, were put in motion by oxen or buffalos and
from the foot of these the expressed juice was conveyed, by a
tube carried under the floor, into a boiler that was sunk in the
ground at the end of the apartment; where it was boiled to a
proper degree of consistence the expressed canes serving as
fuel. Though unacquainted with the process of refining sugar,
the natural tendency that the syrup possesses of forming itself
into crystals in cooling had suggested to them the means of
obtaining very fine and pure sugar-candy which, in the market
of Canton, is sold in a pulverized state as white as the best refined
sugar. The coarse syrup, usually called treacle or
molasses, and the dregs, are not employed, as in the West
India islands, in the distillation of rum, but are sometimes
thrown into the still with fermented rice, in order to procure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
better kind of <i>Seau-tchoo</i> or <i>burnt</i> wine; the chief use, however,
of the molasses is to preserve fruits and other vegetable productions;
and particularly the roots of ginger, a conserve of which
the Chinese are remarkably fond.</p>

<p>The bed of the river having, in the lapse of ages, settled to
the depth of twenty, thirty, or even forty feet below the general
level of the country, it became necessary to employ some artificial
means of obtaining the water for the purpose, of irrigation.
The contrivance made use of to raise it to the height of the
banks was simple and ingenious; and from hence it was conveyed
in small channels to every part of the cane plantations.
Of the useful machine employed for this purposes consisting
of a bamboo wheel which I understand has been adopted
in America, a view and section may be seen among the plates
accompanying Sir George Staunton's authentic account of the
embassy. I shall therefore content myself with observing in
this place that, the axis excepted, it is entirely constructed of
bamboo, without the assistance of a single nail or piece of iron;
that the expence of making it is a mere trifle; that in its operations
it requires no attendance, and that it will lift, to the
height of forty feet, one hundred and fifty tons of water
in the course of twenty-four hours<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Every plantation near
this part of the river had its wheel and some of them two;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>and the water raised by them was sometimes conveyed at once
into the plots of canes and some times into reservoirs, out of
which it was afterwards pumped, as occasion might require, by
the chain-pump and carried to those places where it might be
wanted along small channels coated with clay.</p>

<p>The women of this province were more robust than ordinary
and well suited, by their strength and muscular powers, to endure
the hard labour and drudgery of the field, which seemed
to be their chief employment. This sort of labour, however,
might be the cause, rather than the consequence, of their extraordinary
strength and masculine form. The habitual use of
hard labour, to which the women are here brought up, fits
them best to become the wives of the peasantry in the neighbouring
provinces; and accordingly, when a Chinese farmer is desirous
of purchasing a working wife he makes his offers in
<i>Kiang-see</i>. It was here that we saw a woman yoked literally by
traces to a plough, whilst the husband or master had the lighter
task of holding it by one hand and drilling in the seed with the
other. The exertion of labour together with the constant exposure
to the weather, in a climate situated under the twenty-fifth
to the twenty-ninth parallel of latitude, have contributed
to render more coarse and forbidding the features of the fair sex
of <i>Kiang-see</i>, in the formation of which, indeed, Nature had not
been too bountiful. Like the women of the Malay nation, with
whom they most probably are derived from one common stock,
they fixed their strong black hair close to the head by two metal
skewers. Their dress, in other respects, was the same as that
of the men, and like these they wore straw sandals on their feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
Thus far, by avoiding the pain attendant on fashionable feet,
and enjoying the free use of their limbs, they might be said to
have the advantage of the city ladies. It was, indeed, observed
that even such as were not employed in the labours of the field,
but kept constantly at home for domestic purposes, were, in this
province, equally exempted from the barbarous fashion of cramping
the feet.</p>

<p>On the 9th we again entered a narrow defile and here with
difficulty the vessels were forced along against a strong current;
and over the pebbly bottom, against which they were constantly
striking. At <i>Nan-gan-foo</i>, where we arrived in the evening,
the river ceases to be navigable. Indeed the whole of the three
last days' navigation might, with propriety, in England be
called only a trout stream; upon which no nation on earth,
except the Chinese, would have conceived the idea of floating
any kind of craft; they have however adapted, in an admirable
manner, the form and construction of their vessels to the
nature and depth of the navigation; towards the upper part of
the present river they drew only, when moderately laden,
about six inches of water. They were from fifty to seventy
feet in length, narrow and flat-bottomed, a little curved, so
that they took the ground only in the middle point. Yet, in
several places, the water was so shallow that they could not be
dragged over until a channel had been made, by removing the
stones and gravel with iron rakes. The length of this river,
from its source at <i>Nan-gan-foo</i> to the <i>Po-yang</i> lake, is nearly
three hundred English miles. The banks in the low part of
the province of <i>Kiang-see</i> consisted of a deep soil of black earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
supported on clay of a dark red or brown colour; denoting the
presence of iron. The mountains were chiefly of red sand-stone;
and the soil of the hills, producing the <i>Camellia</i>, was a
brown loam mixed with particles of mica.</p>

<p>We had now before us another land-journey, over the steep
and lofty mountain of <i>Me-lin</i>, whose summit is the boundary
between the two provinces of <i>Kiang-see</i> and <i>Quan-tung</i>; on
the south side of which commences the river <i>Pei-kiang-ho</i> that
flows by the port of Canton; and whose mouth is familiarly
known in Europe by the name of the <i>Bocca Tigris</i>. The
ascent of this mountain, which some undertook on horseback
and others in chairs, was made by a well-paved road, carried
in a zig-zag manner over the very highest point, where a pass
was cut to a considerable depth through a granite rock; a work
that had evidently not been accomplished with any moderate
degree of labour or expence. In the middle of the pass was
a military post, much stronger than ordinary, and it was defended
or, more correctly speaking, it was supplied with two
old pieces of cannon, that had been cast, in all probability, near
two hundred years ago, perhaps by the Jesuits who first taught
them an art which they seem already to have forgotten or
neglected.</p>

<p>The view from the summit towards the southward, over the
province of Canton, was as rich and enchanting as that on the
opposite side was dreary and barren. In descending the gradual
slope of about twelve miles, before the mountain had blended
with the general surface of the country, there was a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
succession of dwellings; so that this whole distance might almost
be considered as one continued street. Half of the buildings
consisted, however, of places of convenience to which passengers
might retire to obey the calls of nature, and the doors, or
rather the openings into such erections, were always invitingly
fronting the street. To each single dwelling, whether alone or
joined with others, was annexed a fabric of this description.
Each was constructed upon a large terrace cistern, lined with
such materials that no absorption could take place; and straw
and other dry rubbish are thrown in by the owners, from time
to time, to prevent evaporation. In one of the streets of Canton
is a row of buildings of this kind which, in so warm a
climate, is a dreadful nuisance; but the consideration of preserving
that kind of manure, which by the Chinese is considered
as superior for forcing vegetation to all others, has got the better
of both decency and prudence.</p>

<p>All the passengers we met upon this road were laden with
jars of oil expressed from the Camellia. In the course of
eighteen miles, which is about the distance from the summit
of <i>Me-lin</i> to the city of <i>Nan-sheun-foo</i>, we passed at least a
thousand persons on their way to <i>Nan-gan-foo</i>, each bearing ten
or twelve gallons of oil and among these were a number of
women.</p>

<p>Having now traversed five of the provinces of China, that
are considered among the most populous and productive in the
empire, a general sketch may be drawn, by taking a retrospective
view, of the state of agriculture and the condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>the people; of their habitations, dress, diet and means of
subsistence; and some conclusion drawn as to the population
of the country.</p>

<p>It was a remark too singular to escape notice that, except in
the neighbourhood of the <i>Po-yang</i> lake, the peasantry of the
province in which the capital stands were more miserable,
their houses more mean and wretched, and their lands in a
worse state of cultivation, than in any other part of the route&mdash;a
remark which also agrees with the accounts given by the
Dutch embassy of that part of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, on the south-west
side of the capital, through which they passed. Four mud
walls covered over with a thatch of reeds, or the straw of millet,
or the stems of holcus, compose their habitations; and they
are most commonly surrounded with clay walls, or with a fence
made of the strong stems of the <i>Holcus Sorghum</i>. A partition of
matting divides the hovel into two apartments; each of which has
a small opening in the wall to admit the air and light; but one
door generally serves as an entrance, the closure of which is
frequently nothing more than a strong mat. A blue cotton
jacket and a pair of trowsers, a straw hat and shoes of the same
material, constitute the dress of the majority of the people.
Matting of reeds or bamboo, a cylindrical pillow of wood covered
with leather, a kind of rug or felt blanket made of the
hairy wool of the broad-tailed sheep, not spun and woven but
beat together as in the process for making hats, and sometimes
a mattress stuffed with wool, hair, or straw, constitute their
bedding. Two or three jars, a few basons of earthen-ware of
the coarsest kind, a large iron pot, a frying-pan and a portable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
stove, are the chief articles of furniture. Chairs and tables are
not necessary; both men and women sit on their heels; and in
this posture they surround the great iron pot, with each a bason
in his hands, when they take their meals. The poverty of
their food was sufficiently indicated by their meagre appearance.
It consists chiefly of boiled rice, millet, or other grain,
with the addition of onions or garlic, and mixed sometimes
with a few other vegetables that, by way of relish, are fried in
rancid oil, extracted from a variety of plants, such as the <i>Seffamum</i>,
<i>Brassica orientalis</i>, <i>Cytisus Cadjan</i>, a species of <i>Dolichos</i>,
and, among others, from the same species of <i>Ricinus</i> or <i>Palma-Christi</i>,
from which the Castor is drawn, and used only in
Europe as a powerful purgative. Its drastic qualities may
probably be diminished by applying less pressure in extracting
the oil, or by habit, or by using it fresh, as it does not appear
that the Chinese suffer any inconvenience in its application to
culinary purposes. As well as I could understand, the seeds
were first bruised and then boiled in water, and the oil that
floated on the surface was skimmed off. Our Florence oil they
affected not to admire having, as they said, no taste. The
Chinese, like the inhabitants of the South of Europe, seem to
attach a higher value on oils, in proportion as age has given to
them a higher degree of rancidity.</p>

<p>Fish of any kind, in this part of the country, is a great rarity;
few are caught in the rivers of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>. We met with none
in the whole province, except at <i>Tien-sing</i> and in the capital,
whose market, no doubt, like that of London, draws to its
center the choice products of a very extensive circuit. Salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
dried fish, it is true, are brought from the southward as articles
of commerce, but the poor peasantry cannot afford to purchase
them for general use. They obtain them only sometimes by
bartering millet or vegetables in exchange. A morsel of pork to
relish their rice is almost the only kind of meat that the poor can
afford to taste. They have little milk and neither butter, nor
cheese, nor bread; articles of nourishment to which, with potatoes,
the peasantry of Europe owe their chief support. Boiled rice, indeed,
and not bread, is considered as an article of the first necessity,
the staff of life in China. Hence the monosyllable <i>fan</i>,
which signifies boiled rice, enters into every compound that
implies eating; thus <i>tche-fan</i>, the name of a meal in general, is
to eat rice; breakfast is called the <i>tsao-fan</i> or morning rice,
and supper the <i>ouan-fan</i> or evening rice. Their principal and
indeed their best beverage is bad tea, boiled over and over again
as long as any bitter remains in the leaves, taken without milk
or sugar, or any other ingredient except, in cold weather, a
little ginger. In this weak state the only purpose it seems to
answer is that of carrying down the sediment of muddy water
that abounds in all the flat provinces of China, which the
leaves of tea (as I fancy those of any other plant would) are
found to do. These poor creatures, however, are instructed
by popular opinion to ascribe to it many extraordinary qualities<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>It would require a more familiar acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
people and a longer residence among them, than was allowed
to us, to explain the true reason of such real poverty among
the peasantry in the vicinity of the capital. Perhaps, indeed,
it may be owing, in a great degree, to the proximity of the
court, which in all countries has the effect of drawing together
a crowd of people to consume the products of the soil, without
contributing any portion of labour towards their production.
The encouragement that is here given to idleness and dissipation
is but too apt to entice the young peasantry in the neighbourhood
from their houses, and thus rob the country of its best
hands. The soil, likewise, near the capital is barren and sandy,
producing few supplies beyond the wants of the several tenants;
and all other necessaries of life not raised by them must be purchased
extravagantly dear. It is, indeed, surprizing how this
immense city, said to contain three millions of inhabitants, is
contrived to be supplied at any rate, considering the very sterile
and unproductive state of the country for many miles around
it. It might not, however, be a matter of less astonishment to
a Chinese, nor less difficult for him to conceive, in what manner
our own capital receives its daily supplies, especially after
he had observed that there is not a single road, by which Lon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>don
can be approached, that is not carried over vast tracts of uncultivated
commons and waste grounds.</p>

<p>The vallies of Tartary furnish beeves and broad-tailed sheep
for Pekin, and grain is brought by water from every part of
the country, of which the government takes the precaution to
lay up in store a sufficient quantity for a twelvemonth's consumption.
Of animal food, pork is mostly consumed. Few
peasants are without their breed of hogs; these animals, indeed,
are likewise kept in large cities, where they become public
nuisances. Bad beef in Pekin sells for about six-pence the
pound; mutton and pork eight-pence; lean fowls and ducks
from two to three shillings; eggs are generally about one penny
each; small loaves of bread that are boiled in steam, without
yeast or leaven, are about four-pence a pound; rice sells usually
at three-halfpence or two-pence the pound; wheat flour at
two-pence halfpenny or three-pence; fine tea from twelve to
thirty shillings a pound; that of the former price, at least such
as was procured clandestinely for us, not drinkable, and the
latter not near so good as that of about six shillings in London<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
There are, indeed, plenty of tea-houses in and near
the capital, where the labouring people may purchase their cup
of tea for two small copper coin (not quite a farthing) but it is
miserably bad. A tolerable horse and a man-slave are usually
about the same price, being from fifteen to twenty ounces of
silver. The article of dress worn by the common people is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
very expensive. The peasantry are invariably clad in cotton;
and this article is the produce of most of the provinces. The
complete dress of a peasant is about fifteen shillings; of a common
tradesman three pounds; an officer of government's common
dress ten pounds; of ceremony about thirty pounds; and
if enriched with embroidery and gold and silver tissue, between
two and three hundred pounds: a pair of black satin boots
twenty shillings; and a cap or bonnet about the same sum.
The price of labour, however, and particularly in Pekin, bears
no sort of proportion to the price of provisions. A mechanic
in this city thinks himself well paid if he gets a shilling a-day.
A common weaver, joiner, or other tradesman earns a bare
subsistence for his family; and the best servants may be hired
for an ounce of silver a-month. Many are glad to give their
services in exchange for their subsistence, without any consideration
in hard money. Tobacco being an indispensable article
for all ranks of every age and sex bears of course a high
price in the capital. It is singular enough, that this plant should
have found its way into every part of the world, among savage
as well as civilized nations, even into the deserts of Africa,
where it was found in constant use among the Booshuanas, a
people, till very lately, totally unknown; and it is equally singular,
that an herb of so disagreeable a taste should, by habit,
obtain an ascendency so far over the appetite, as not easily to
be relinquished.</p>

<p>The climate of the northern provinces is unfavourable to the
poor peasantry. The summers are so warm that they go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
nearly naked and the winters so severe that, what with their
poor and scanty fare, their want of fuel, clothing, and even
shelter, thousands are said to perish from cold and hunger. In
such a condition the ties of nature sometimes yield to self-preservation,
and children are sold to save both the parent and offspring
from perishing for want; and infants become a prey to
hopeless indigence. We have seen in the notes taken by the
gentleman in the Dutch embassy, how low the temperature is
at Pekin in the winter months; and they have no coals nearer
than the mountains of Tartary, which are all brought on the
backs of dromedaries; of course, they are extravagantly dear.
In fact, they are scarcely ever burned pure, but are crumbled
to dust and mixed up with earth, in which state they give out
a very strong heat, but no flame, and are suitable enough for
their small close stoves.</p>

<p>Although it is a principle of the Chinese government to admit
of no distinctions among its subjects, except those that learning
and office confer; and although the most rigid sumptuary
laws have been imposed to check that tendency to shew and
splendor, which wealth is apt to assume; and to bring as much
as possible on a level, at least in outward appearance, all conditions
of men; yet, with regard to diet, there is a wider difference
perhaps between the rich and the poor of China, than in
any other country. That wealth which, if permitted, would
be expended in flattering the vanity of its possessors, is now applied
in the purchase of dainties to pamper the appetite. Their
famous <i>Gin-sing</i>, a name signifying <i>the life of man</i> (the <i>Panax
quinquefolium</i> of Linnæus) on account of its supposed invigo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>rating
and aphrodisiac qualities was, for a length of time,
weighed against gold. The sinewy parts of stags and other animals,
with the fins of sharks, as productive of the same effects,
are purchased by the wealthy at enormous prices: and the nests
that are constructed by small swallows on the coasts of Cochin-China,
Cambodia, and other parts of the East, are dearer even
than some kinds of <i>Gin-sing</i>. Most of the plants that grow on
the sea-shore are supposed to possess an invigorating quality,
and are, therefore, in constant use as pickles or preserves, or simply
dried and cut into soups in the place of other vegetables.
The leaves of one of these, apparently a species of that genus of
sea-weed called by botanists <i>fucus</i>, after being gathered, are
steeped in fresh water and hung up to dry. A small quantity
of this weed boiled in water gives to it the consistence of a
jelly, and when mixed with a little sugar, the juice of an orange,
or other fruit, and set by to cool, I know of no jelly more agreeable
or refreshing. The leaf is about six inches long, narrow
and pointed, deeply serrated, and the margins ciliated; the
middle part smooth, semi-transparent, and of a leathery consistence.
The Chinese call it <i>Chin-chou</i>.</p>

<p>The great officers of state make use of these and various
other gelatinous viands for the purpose of acquiring, as they
suppose, a proper degree of corpulency<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, which is considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>by them as respectable and imposing upon the multitude; of
a great portion of whom it may be observed, as Falstaff said
of his company, "No eye hath seen such scare-crows." It
would be rare to find, among the commonalty of China, one
to compare with a porter-drinking citizen or a jolly-looking
farmer of England. They are indeed naturally of a slender
habit of body and a sickly appearance, few having the blush
of health upon their cheeks. The tables of the great are covered
with a vast variety of dishes, consisting mostly of stews
of fish, fowl and meat, separately and jointly, with proper proportions
of vegetables and sauces of different kinds. Their
beverage consists of tea and whiskey. In sipping this ardent spirit,
made almost boiling hot, eating pastry and fruits, and smoking
the pipe, they spend the greatest part of the day, beginning
from the moment they rise and continuing till they go to bed. In
hot weather they sleep in the middle of the day, attended by two servants,
one to fan away the flies and the other to keep them cool.</p>

<p>The province of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i> embraces an extent of climate
from 38° to 40&frac12;° of north latitude. The temperature is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
various. In summer Fahrenheit's thermometer is generally
above 80° during the day, sometimes exceeding 90°; and, in
the middle of winter, it remains for many days together below
the freezing point, descending occasionally to zero or 0. But
it generally enjoys a clear pure atmosphere throughout the whole
year.</p>

<p>In the practical part of agriculture, in this province, we observed
little to attract attention or to commend. The farmer
gets no more than one crop off the ground in a season, and
this is generally one of the species of millets already mentioned,
or holcus, or wheat; but they sometimes plant a <i>Dolichos</i> or
bean between the rows of wheat, which ripens after the latter
is cut down. They have no winter crops, the hard frosty weather
usually setting in towards the end of November and continuing
till the end of March. The three different modes of
sowing grain, by drilling, dibbling, and broadcast, are all in
use but chiefly the first, as being the most expeditious and
the crop most easy to be kept free from weeds; the last is rarely
practised on account of the great waste of seed; and dibbling is
used only in small patches of ground near the houses when they
aim at neatness. The soil, being in general loose and sandy
and free from stones, is worked without much difficulty, but
it seemed to require a good deal of manure; and this necessary
article from the paucity of domestic animals is extremely scarce.
Very few sheep or cattle were observed, yet there was an abundance
of land that did not seem for many years to have felt the
ploughshare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>The draught cattle most generally in use are oxen, mules,
and asses. Horses are scarce and of a small miserable breed,
incapable of much work; a remark, indeed, which will apply to
every province of the empire; though those of Tartary, which
composed the Emperor's stud, according to the Embassador's
description, were not wanting in point of size, beauty, or spirit.
No pains, however, are bestowed to effect, nor do they seem
to be sensible of the advantages to be derived from, an improvement
in the breed of cattle. Nor indeed is any care taken of
the bad breed which they already possess. It would be supposed
that, where a regular establishment of cavalry is kept up
to an amount that seems almost incredible, some attention
would be paid to the nature and condition of their horses.
This, however, is not the case. A Scotch poney, wild from the
mountains, which has never felt the teeth of a currycomb and
whose tail and mane are clotted together with dirt, is in fit
condition to join a regiment of Tartar cavalry. Those kept
by men in office are equally neglected. The Chinese have no
idea that this noble animal requires any attention beyond that
of giving him his food; and of this, in general, he receives a
very scanty portion.</p>

<p>That part of the province of <i>Shan-tung</i> through which we
travelled exhibited a greater variety of culture than <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>;
but the surface of the northern parts especially was equally
uniform. The soil, consisting generally of mud and slime
brought apparently by the inundations of rivers, contained not
a single pebble. The season was too late to form any estimate
of the crops produced upon the immense plains of <i>Shan-tung</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
but the young crops of wheat, standing at this time (the middle
of October) a few inches above the ground, looked extremely
well. Little waste ground occurred, except the footpaths and
the channels which served as division marks of property. Some
attempts indeed were here made at the division of grounds by
hedge-rows, but with little success; the plant they had adopted,
the <i>Palma-Christi</i>, was ill-suited for such a purpose. As we advanced
to the southward, in this province, the proportion of
wheat under cultivation diminished, and its place was employed
by plantations of cotton, whose pods were now ripe and bursting.
The plant was low and poor in growth, but the branches
were laden with pods. Like the wheat it was planted or dibbled
in rows. The cotton produced the second year was said
to be considered as equally good with that of the first, but being
found to degenerate the third year, it was then rooted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
and the ground prepared for fresh seed<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>The southern parts of <i>Shan-tung</i> are composed of mountains
and swamps. Here, lakes of various magnitudes occur and
large tracts of country similar to those which are known to us
by the name of peat-moss. In such places the population could
not be expected to be excessive; and, accordingly, we met with
few inhabitants, except those who subsisted their families by
fishing. So great were the numbers engaged in this employment,
who lived entirely in floating vessels, that we judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
the waters to be fully as populous as the land. No rent is exacted
by the government, nor toll, nor tythe, nor licence-money
for permission to catch fish; nor is there any sort of impediment
against the free use of any lake, river or canal whatsoever.
The gifts that nature has bestowed are cautiously usurped by
any power, even in this despotic government, for individual
use or profit; but are suffered to remain the free property of all
who may chuse by their labour to derive advantage from them.
But even this free and unrestrained use is barely sufficient to
procure for them the necessaries, much less any of the comforts,
of life. The condition of the peasantry, in the northern parts
of this province, was much more desirable. Their clothing
was decent; their countenances cheerful, indicating plenty;
and their dwellings were built of bricks or wood, appearing
more solid and comfortable than those of the province in which
the capital is situated. But the poor fishermen carried about
with them unequivocal marks of their poverty. Their pale
meagre looks are ascribed to the frequent, and almost exclusive,
use of fish; which is supposed to give them a scrophulous
habit of body. Their endeavours, however, are not wanting
to correct any acid or unwholesome humours that this sort of
diet may produce, by the abundant use of onions and garlic,
which they cultivate even upon the waters. Having no houses
on shore, nor stationary abode, but moving about in their vessels
upon the extensive lakes and rivers, they have no inducement
to cultivate patches of ground, which the pursuits of their
profession might require them to leave for the profit of another;
they prefer, therefore, to plant their onions on rafts of
bamboo, well interwoven with reeds and strong grass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
covered with earth; and these floating gardens are towed after
their boats.</p>

<p>The women assist in dragging the net and other operations
of taking fish; but the younger part of the family are sometimes
employed in breeding ducks. These stupid birds here acquire
an astonishing degree of docility. In a single vessel are sometimes
many hundreds which, like the cattle of the Kaffers in
southern Africa, on the signal of a whistle leap into the water,
or upon the banks to feed, and another whistle brings them back.
Like the ancient Egyptians, they use artificial means of hatching
eggs, by burying them in sand at the bottom of wooden boxes,
and placing them on plates of iron kept moderately warm by
small furnaces underneath. Thus the old birds which, provided
they hatched their eggs themselves, would only produce
one brood, or at most two, in the course of the year, continue
to lay eggs almost every month. Hogs are also kept in many
of the fishing craft. In fact, ducks and hogs affording the most
savory meat, most abounding in fat and, it may be added, best
able to subsist themselves, are esteemed above all other animals.
The ducks being split open, salted, and dried in the sun, are
exchanged for rice or other grain. In this state we found
them an excellent relish; and, at our request, they were
plentifully supplied during the whole progress through the
country.</p>

<p>The province of <i>Shan-tung</i> extends in latitude from thirty-four
and a half to thirty-eight degrees. The mean temperature,
from the 19th of October to the 29th of the same month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
was about fifty-two degrees at sun-rise, to seventy degrees at
noon. A constant clear and cloudless sky.</p>

<p>The numerous canals and rivers, that in every direction intersect
the province of <i>Kiang-nan</i>, and by which it is capable of being
flooded to any extent in the dryest seasons, render it one of
the most valuable and fertile districts in the whole empire. Every
part of it, also, having a free communication with the Yellow
Sea by the two great rivers, the <i>Whang-ho</i> and the <i>Yang-tse-kiang</i>,
it has always been considered as the central point for
the home trade; and, at one time, its chief city Nankin was
the capital of the empire. That beautiful and durable cotton
of the same name is here produced and sent to the port of
Canton; from whence it is shipped off to the different parts
of the world. The Chinese rarely wear it in its natural
colour, except as an article of mourning; but export it chiefly,
taking in return vast quantifies of unmanufactured white cotton
from Bengal and Bombay, finding they can purchase this
foreign wool at a much cheaper rate than that at which the
nankin sells. For mourning dresses and a few other purposes
white cotton is made use of, but in general it is dyed black or
blue: among some of our presents were also pieces of a beautiful
scarlet. Near most of the plantations of cotton we observed
patches of indigo; a plant which grows freely in all the
middle and southern provinces. The dye of this shrub being
no article of commerce in China is seldom, if ever, prepared
in a dry state, but is generally employed to communicate its
colouring matter from the leaves, to avoid the labour and the
loss that would be required to reduce it to a solid substance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
We observed that, in the cotton countries, almost every cottage
had its garden of indigo. As in ancient times, in our own
country, when every cottager brewed his own beer; kept his
own cow for milk and butter; bred his own sheep, the wool of
which being spun into yarn by his own family was manufactured
into cloth by the parish weaver; and when every peasant
raised the materials for his own web of hempen cloth; so it still
appears to be the case in China. Here there are no great farmers
nor monopolists of grain; nor can any individual nor
body of men, by any possibility, either glut the market, or withhold
the produce of the ground, as may best suit their purpose.
Each peasant is supposed, by his industry, to have the means
of subsistence within himself; though it often happens that
these means, from adverse circumstances which hereafter will
be noticed, fail of producing the desired effect.</p>

<p>In the province of <i>Kiang-nan</i> each grows his own cotton; his
wife and children spin it into thread and it is woven into a web
in his own house, sometimes by his own family, but more frequently
by others hired for the purpose. A few bamboos constitute
the whole machinery required for this operation. Money
he has none; but his produce he can easily barter for any little
article of necessity or luxury. The superfluities of life, which
those in office may have occasion to purchase, are paid for in
bars of silver without any impression, but bearing value for weight,
like the Roman <i>as</i> or the Hebrew <i>shekel</i>. The only coin in circulation
is the <i>tchen</i>, a piece of some inferior metal mixed with
a small proportion of copper, of the value of the thousandth
part of an ounce of silver; with this small piece of money the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
little and constantly demanded necessaries of life are purchased,
such as could not conveniently be obtained by way of barter. Silver
is rarely lent out at interest, except between mercantile men
in large cities. The legal interest is twelve per cent. but it is
commonly extended to eighteen, sometimes even to thirty-six.
To avoid the punishment of usury, what is given above twelve
per cent. is in the shape of a <i>bonus</i>. "Usury, in China," observes
Lord Macartney, "like gaming elsewhere, is a dishonourable
mode of getting money; but by a sort of compact
between necessity and avarice, between affluence and distress,
the prosecution of a Jew or a sharper is considered by us as
not very honourable even in the sufferers."</p>

<p>The greater the distance from the capital, the better was the
apparent condition of the people. The Viceroy, when he
received his Excellency on the entry of the embassy into this
province, happened to cast his eye upon the half-starved and
half-naked trackers of the boats; and being either ashamed of
their miserable appearance, or feeling compassion for their situation,
he ordered every man immediately a suit of new cloaths.
In the morning, when our force was mustered, we were not
a little surprized to see the great alteration that had taken place
in the appearance of our trackers: every man had a blue cotton
jacket edged with red, a pair of new white trowsers, and a
smart hat with a high crown and feather. The natural fertility
of the country, its central situation commanding a brisk trade,
the abundance of its fisheries on the large rivers and lakes
were incentives to industry, for the vast population that seemed
to be equally distributed over every part of the province.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>Rice being the staple of China was abundantly cultivated,
in all such places as afforded the greatest command of water.
The usual average produce of corn-lands is reckoned to be from
ten to fifteen for one; and of rice, from twenty-five to thirty;
commonly about thirty. Those corn-lands that will admit of
easy irrigation are usually turned over with the plough immediately
after the grain is cut; which, in the middle provinces,
is ready for the sickle early in June, about the same time that the
young rice fields stand at the height of eight or ten inches.
These being now thinned, the young plants are transplanted
into the prepared wheat lands, which are then immediately
flooded. Upon such a crop they reckon from fifteen to twenty
for one. Instead of rice one of the millets is sometimes sown
as an after-crop, this requiring very little water, or the <i>Cadjan</i>,
a species of <i>Dolichos</i> or small bean, for oil, requiring still
less. Or, it is a common practice, after taking off a crop of
cotton and indigo, in the month of October, to sow wheat, in
order to have the land again clear in the month of May or
June. Such a succession of crops, without ever suffering the
land to lie fallow, should seem to require a large quantity of
manure. In fact, they spare no pains in procuring composts
and manures; but they also accomplish much without these
materials, by working the soil almost incessantly and mixing
it with extraneous matters as, for instance, marle with light
and sandy soils, or if this is not to be had, stiff clay; and on
clayey grounds they carry sand and gravel. They also drag the
rivers and canals and pools of water for slime and mud; and
they preserve, with great care, all kinds of urine, in which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
is an universal practice to steep the seeds previous to their being
sown. If turnip-seeds be steeped in lime and urine, the plant
is said not to be attacked by the insect. Near all the houses
are large earthen jars sunk in the ground, for collecting and
preserving these and other materials that are convertible, by
putrefactive fermentation, into manure. Old men and children
may be seen near all the villages with small rakes and
baskets, collecting every kind of dirt, or offals, that come in
their way. Their eagerness to pick up whatever may be used
as manure led to some ridiculous scenes. Whenever our barges
halted and the soldiers and servants found it necessary to step
on shore, they were always pursued to their place of retirement
by these collectors of food for vegetables. It may literally be
said in this country, that nothing is suffered to be lost. The
profession of shaving is followed by vast numbers in China.
As the whole head is shaved, except a small lock behind, few,
if any, are able to operate upon themselves. And as hair is
considered an excellent manure, every barber carries with him
a small bag to collect the spoils of his razor.</p>

<p>The common plough of the country is a simple machine
and much inferior to the very worst of ours. We saw one
drill plough in <i>Shan-tung</i> different from all the rest. It consisted
of two parallel poles of wood, shod at the lower extremities
with iron to open the furrows; these poles were
placed on wheels: a small hopper was attached to each
pole to drop the seed into the furrows, which were covered
with earth by a transverse piece of wood fixed behind, that
just swept the surface of the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>The machine usually employed for clearing rice from the
husk, in the large way, is exactly the same as that now used
in Egypt for the same purpose, only that the latter is put in
motion by oxen and the former commonly by water. This
machine consists of a long horizontal axis of wood, with cogs
or projecting pieces of wood or iron fixed upon it, at certain
intervals, and it is turned by a water-wheel. At right angles
to this axis are fixed as many horizontal levers as there are
circular rows of cogs; these levers act on pivots, that are
fastened into a low brick wall built parallel to the axis, and at
the distance of about two feet from it. At the further extremity
of each lever, and perpendicular to it, is fixed a hollow pestle,
directly over a large mortar of stone or iron sunk into the
ground; the other extremity extending beyond the wall, being
pressed upon by the cogs of the axis in its revolution, elevates
the pestle, which by its own gravity falls into the mortar.
An axis of this kind sometimes gives motion to fifteen or twenty
levers. This machine<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, as well as the plough, still in use in
modern Egypt, which is also the same as the Chinese plough,
have been considered by a member of the French Institute to be
the same instruments as those employed in that country two
thousand years ago; and judging from the maxims of the Chinese
government, and the character of the people, an antiquity
equally great may be assigned to them in the latter country. The
bamboo wheel for raising water, or something approaching very
near to it, either with buckets appended to the circumference,
or with fellies hollowed out so as to scoop up water, was also in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>use among the ancient Egyptians; and, as I have before observed,
continue to be so among the Syrians; from these they
are supposed to have passed into Persia, where they are also still
employed, and from whence they have derived, in Europe,
the name of Persian wheels. The chain-pump of China, common
in the hands of every farmer, was likewise an instrument
of husbandry in Egypt.</p>

<p>A very erroneous opinion seems to have been entertained in
Europe, with regard to the skill of the Chinese in agriculture.
Industrious they certainly are, in an eminent degree, but their
labour does not always appear to be bestowed with judgment.
The instruments, in the first place, they make use of are incapable
of performing the operations of husbandry to the greatest
advantage. In the deepest and best soils, their plough seldom
cuts to the depth of four inches, so that they sow from year to
year upon the same soil, without being able to turn up new
earth, and to bury the worn-out mould to refresh itself. Supposing
them, however, to be supplied with ploughs of the best
construction, we can scarcely conceive that their mules and
asses and old women, would be equal to the task of drawing
them.</p>

<p>The advantage that large farms in England possess over small
ones consists principally in the means they afford the tenant
of keeping better teams than can possibly be done on the latter,
and consequently of making a better <i>tilth</i> for the reception of
seed. The opulent farmer, on the same quantity of ground,
will invariably raise more produce than the cottager can pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
to do. In China nine-tenths of the peasantry may be considered
as cottagers, and having few cattle (millions I might add
none at all) it can scarcely be expected that the whole country
should be in the best possible state of cultivation. As horticulturists
they may perhaps be allowed a considerable share of merit;
but, on the great scale of agriculture, they are certainly not
to be mentioned with many European nations. They have no
knowledge of the modes of improvement practised in the various
breeds of cattle; no instruments for breaking up and preparing
waste lands; no system for draining and reclaiming
swamps and morasses; though that part of the country over
which the grand communication is effected between the two extremities
of the empire, abounds with lands of this nature,
where population is excessive and where the multitudes of
shipping that pass and repass create a never failing demand for
grain and other vegetable products. For want of this knowledge,
a very considerable portion of the richest land, perhaps,
in the whole empire, is suffered to remain a barren and unprofitable
waste. If an idea may be formed from what we saw in
the course of our journey, and from the accounts that have been
given of the other provinces, I should conclude, that one-fourth
part of the whole country nearly consists of lakes and
low, sour, swampy grounds, which are totally uncultivated: and
which, among other reasons hereafter to be mentioned, may
serve to explain the frequent famines that occur in a more satisfactory
way, than by supposing, with the Jesuits, that they are
owing to the circumstance of the nations bordering upon them
to the westward being savage and growing no corn. Their
ignorance of draining, or their dread of inundations, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
the low countries of China, in their present state, are subject,
may perhaps have driven them, in certain situations, to the
necessity of levelling the sides of mountains into a succession of
terraces; a mode of cultivation frequently taken notice of by
the missionaries as unexampled in Europe and peculiar to the
Chinese; whereas it is common in many parts of Europe. The
mountains of the <i>Pays de Vaud</i>, between <i>Lausanne</i> and <i>Vevay</i>,
are cultivated in this manner to their summits with vines.
"This would have been impracticable," says Doctor Moore,
"on account of the steepness, had not the proprietors built
strong stone walls at proper intervals, one above the other,
which support the soil, and <a name="form" id="form"></a>form little terraces <a name="from" id="from"></a>from the bottom
to the top of the mountains." But this method of terracing
the hills is not to be considered, by any means, as a common
practice in China. In our direct route it occurred only
twice, and then on so small a scale as hardly to deserve notice.
The whole territorial right being vested in the sovereign, the
waste lands of course belong to the crown; but any person, by
giving notice to the proper magistrate, may obtain a property
therein, so long as he continues to pay such portion of the estimated
produce as is required to be collected into the public magazines.</p>

<p>When I said that the Chinese might claim a considerable share
of merit as horticulturists, I meant to confine the observation to
their skill and industry of raising the greatest possible quantity
of vegetables from a given piece of ground. Of the modes
practised in Europe of improving the quality of fruit, they seem
to have no just notion. Their oranges are naturally good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
require no artificial means of improvement, but the European
fruits, as apples, pears, plums, peaches and apricots are of indifferent
quality. They have a common method of propagating several
kinds of fruit-trees, which of late years has been practised with
success in Bengal. The method is simply this: they strip a ring
of bark, about an inch in width, from a bearing branch, surround
the place with a ball of fat earth or loam bound fast to
the branch with a piece of matting; over this they suspend a pot
or horn with water having a small hole in the bottom just sufficient
to let the water drop, in order to keep the earth constantly
moist; the branch throws new roots into the earth just above
the place where the ring was stripped off; the operation is performed
in the spring, and the branch is sawn off and put into
the ground at the fall of the leaf; the following year it bears
fruit. They have no method of forcing vegetables by artificial
heat, or by excluding the cold air and admitting, at the same
time, the rays of the sun through glass. Their chief merit consists
in preparing the soil, working it incessantly, and keeping it
free of weeds.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, if I might venture to offer an opinion with
respect to the merit of the Chinese as agriculturists, I should not
hesitate to say that, let as much ground be given to one of their
peasants as he and his family can work with the spade, and he
will turn that piece of ground to more advantage, and produce
from it more sustenance for the use of man, than any European
whatsoever would be able to do; but, let fifty or one hundred
acres of the best land in China be given to a farmer, at a mean
rent, so far from making out of it the value of three rents, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
which our farmers usually calculate, he would scarcely be able
to support his family, after paying the expence of labour that
would be required to work the farm.</p>

<p>In fact there are no great farms in China. The inhabitants enjoy
every advantage which may be supposed to arise from the lands
being pretty equally divided among them, an advantage of
which the effects might probably answer the expectations of
those who lean towards such a system, were they not counteracted
by circumstances that are not less prejudicial, perhaps, to
the benefit of the public, than monopolizing farmers are by such
persons supposed to be in our own country. One of the circumstances
I allude to is the common practice, in almost every part
of the country, of assembling together in towns and villages,
between which very frequently the intermediate space of ground
has not a single habitation upon it; and the reason assigned for
this custom is the dread of the bands of robbers that infest
the weak and unprotected parts of the country. The consequence of
such a system is, that although the lands adjoining
the villages be kept in the highest state of cultivation, yet those
at a distance are suffered to remain almost useless; for having
no beasts of burden, it would be an endless task of human labour
to bear the manure that would be required, for several
miles, upon the ground, and its produce from thence back again
to the village. That such robbers do exist who, in formidable
gangs, plunder the peasantry, is very certain: <i>She-fo-pao</i> was
watching his grain to prevent its being stolen, when he had the
misfortune of shooting his relation, who had also gone out for
the same purpose. They are sometimes indeed so numerous, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
to threaten their most populous cities. The frequency of such
robberies and the alarm they occasion to the inhabitants are
neither favourable to the high notions that have been entertained
of the Chinese government, nor of the morals of the people.
Another, and perhaps the chief, disadvantage arising from landed
property being pretty equally divided, will be noticed in speaking
of the population and the frequent famines.</p>

<p>The province of <i>Kiang-nan</i> extends from about 31° to 34&frac12;°
of northern latitude; and the mean temperature, according to
Fahrenheit's thermometer, from the 30th of October to the
9th of November, was 54° at sun-rise and 66° at noon; the
sky uniformly clear.</p>

<p>The province of <i>Tche-kiang</i> abounds in lakes and is intersected
with rivers and canals like <i>Kiang-nan</i>; but the produce,
except that of a little rice, is very different, consisting principally
of silk. For feeding the worms that afford this article,
all the fertile and beautiful vallies between the mountains, as
well as the plains, are covered with plantations of the mulberry-tree.
The small houses, in which the worms are reared, are
placed generally in the centre of each plantation; in order that
they may be removed as far as possible from any kind of noise;
experience having taught them, that a sudden shout, or the
bark of a dog, is destructive of the young worms. A whole
brood has sometimes perished by a thunder storm. The greatest
attention is, therefore, necessary; and, accordingly, they are
watched night and day. In fine weather, the young worms
are exposed to the sun, upon a kind of thin open gauze stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
in wooden frames; and at night they are replaced in the
plantation houses. The trees are pruned from time to time,
in order to cause a greater quantity and a constant succession
of young leaves. The inhabitants of this province, especially
in the cities, are almost universally clothed in silks; this rule
among the Chinese of consuming, as much as possible, the products
of their own country, and receiving as little as they can
avoid from foreign nations, extends even to the provinces; a
practice arising out of the little respect that, in China, as in ancient
Rome, is paid to those concerned in trade and merchandize.</p>

<p>Besides silk <i>Tche-kiang</i> produces camphor, tallow from the
<i>Croton</i>, a considerable quantity of tea, oranges, and almost all
the fruits that are peculiar to the country. Every part of the
province appeared to be in the highest state of cultivation and
the population to be immense. Both the raw and manufactured
silks, nankins and other cotton cloths, were sold at such
low prices in the capital of this province, that it is difficult to
conceive how the growers or the manufacturers contrived to
gain a livelihood by their labour. But of all others, I am the
most astonished at the small returns that must necessarily be
made to the cultivators of the tea plant. The preparations of
some of the finer kinds of this article are said to require that
every leaf should be rolled singly by the hand; particularly such
as are exported to the European markets. Besides this, there
are many processes, such as steeping, drying, turning, and packing,
after it has been plucked off the shrub leaf by leaf. Yet
the first cost in the tea provinces cannot be more than from four-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>pence
to two shillings a pound, when it is considered that the
ordinary teas stand the East India Company in no more than
eight-pence a pound; and the very best only two shillings
and eight-pence<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Nothing can more clearly point out the
patient and unremitting labour of the Chinese, than the
preparation of this plant for the market. It is a curious circumstance
that a body of merchants in England should furnish
employment, as might easily be made appear, to more than a
million subjects of a nation that affects to despise merchants,
and throws every obstacle in the way of commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of <i>Tche-kiang</i>, in the middle of November,
was from fifty-six degrees at sun-rise, to sixty-two degrees
at noon. The extent from North to South is between
the parallels of twenty-eight and thirty-four and a half degrees
of northern latitude.</p>

<p>The northern part of <i>Kiang-see</i> contains the great <i>Po-yang</i>
lake, and those extensive swamps and morasses that surround
it, and which, as I have already observed, may be considered as
the sink of China. The middle and southern parts are mountainous.
The chief produce is sugar and oil from the <i>Camellia
Sesanqua</i>. In this province are the principal manufactories of
porcelain, whose qualities, as I have in a former chapter ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>served,
depend more on the care bestowed in the preparation
and in the selection of the materials, than in any secret art
possessed by them. There are also, in this province, large
manufactories of coarse earthen ware, of tiles, and bricks.</p>

<p>The extent of <i>Kiang-see</i> is from twenty-eight to thirty
degrees, and the temperature, in November, was the same as
that of the neighbouring province of <i>Tche-kiang</i>.</p>

<p>I have now to mention a subject on which much has already
been written by various authors, but without the success of
having carried conviction into the minds of their readers, that
the things which they offered as facts were either true or possible;
I allude to the populousness of this extensive empire.
That none of the statements hitherto published are strictly true,
I am free to admit, but that the highest degree of populousness
that has yet been assigned may be possible, and even probable,
I am equally ready to contend. At the same time, I acknowledge
that, prepared as we were, from all that we had seen and heard
and read on the subject, for something very extraordinary;
yet when the following statement was delivered, at the request
of the Embassador, by <i>Chou-ta-gin</i>, as the abstract of a census
that had been taken the preceding year, the amount appeared
so enormous as to surpass credibility. But as we had always
found this officer a plain, unaffected, and honest man, who on
no occasion had attempted to deceive or impose on us, we could
not consistently consider it in any other light than as a document
drawn up from authentic materials; its inaccuracy, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
was obvious at a single glance, from the several sums being given
in round millions. I have added to the table the extent of the
provinces, the number of people on a square mile, and the
value of the surplus taxes remitted to Pekin in the year 1792,
as mentioned in the seventh chapter.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Considering then the whole surface of the Chinese dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
within the great wall to contain 1,297,999 square miles, or
830,719,360 English acres, and the population to amount to
333,000,000, every square mile will be found to contain two
hundred and fifty-six persons, and every individual might
possess two acres and a half of land. Great Britain is supposed
to average about one hundred and twenty persons on one square
mile, and that to each inhabitant there might be assigned a
portion of five acres, or to each family five-and-twenty acres.
The population of China, therefore, is to that of Great Britain
as 256 to 120, or in a proportion somewhat greater than two
to one; and the quantity of land that each individual in Great
Britain might possess is just twice as much as could be allowed
to each individual of China. We have only then to enquire if
Britain, under the same circumstances as China, be capable of
supporting twice its present population, or which is the same
thing, if twelve and an half acres of land be sufficient for the
maintenance of a family of five persons? Two acres of choice
land sown with wheat, under good tillage, may be reckoned to
average, after deducting the seed, 60 bushels or 3600 pounds,
which every baker knows would yield 5400 pounds of bread, or
three pounds a day to every member of the family for the whole
year. Half an acre is a great allowance for a kitchen-garden
and potatoe bed. There would still remain ten acres, which
must be very bad land if, besides paying the rent and taxes, it
did not keep three or four cows; and an industrious and managing
family would find no difficulty in rearing as many pigs and
as much poultry as would be necessary for home consumption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
and for the purchase of clothing and other indispensable
necessaries. If then the country was pretty equally partitioned
out in this manner; if the land was applied solely
to produce food for man; if no horses nor superfluous
animals were kept for pleasure, and few only for labour; if
the country was not drained of its best hands in foreign trade
and in large manufactories; if the carriage of goods for exchanging
with other goods was performed by canals and rivers and
lakes, all abounding with fish; if the catching of these fish gave
employment to a very considerable portion of the inhabitants;
if the bulk of the people were satisfied to abstain almost wholly
from animal food, except such as is most easily procured, that
of pigs and ducks and fish; if only a very small part of the
grain raised was employed in the distilleries, but was used as
the staff of life for man; and if this grain was of such a nature
as to yield twice, and even three times, the produce that
wheat will give on the same space of ground; if, moreover, the
climate was so favourable as to allow two such crops every year&mdash;if,
under all these circumstances, twelve and a half acres of
land would not support a family of five persons; the fault
could only be ascribed to idleness or bad management.</p>

<p>Let us then, for a moment, consider that these or similar advantages
operate in China; that every product of the ground is
appropriated solely for the food and clothing of man; that a
single acre of land, sown with rice, will yield a sufficient quantity
for the consumption of five people for a whole year, allowing
to each person two pounds a-day, provided the returns of
his crop are from twenty to twenty-five for one, which are considered
as extremely moderate, being frequently more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
twice this quantity; that in the southern provinces two crops
of rice are produced in the year, one acre of which I am well
assured, with proper culture, will afford a supply of that grain even
for ten persons, and that an acre of cotton will clothe two or
three hundred persons, we may justly infer that, instead of
twelve acres to each family, half that quantity would appear to
be more than necessary; and safely conclude, that there is no
want of land to support the assumed population of three hundred
and thirty-three millions. This being the case, the population
is not yet arrived at a level with the means which the
country affords of subsistence.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no country where the condition of the peasantry
may more justly be compared with those of China than
Ireland. This island, according to the latest survey, contains
about 17,000,000 English acres, 730,000 houses and 3,500,000
souls; so that, as in Great Britain, each individual averages
very nearly five acres and every family five-and-twenty. An
Irish cottager holds seldom more than an Irish acre of land, or
one and three-quarters English nearly, in cultivation, with
a cow's grass, for which he pays a rent from two to five
pounds. Those on Lord Macartney's estate at Lissanore have
their acre, which they cultivate in divisions with oats, potatoes,
kale, and a little flax; with this they have besides the full pasturage
of a cow all the year upon a large waste, not overstocked,
and a comfortable cabin to inhabit, for which each pays the
rent of three pounds. The cottager works perhaps three days in
the week, at nine-pence a-day; if, instead of which, he had a
second acre to cultivate, he would derive more benefit from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
produce than from the product of his three days' labour <i>per</i>
week; that is to say, provided he would expend the same labour
in its tillage. Thus then, supposing only half of Ireland
in a state of cultivation and the other half pasturage, it would
support a population more than three times that which it now
contains; and as a century ago it had no more than a million of
people, so within the present century, under favourable circumstances,
it may increase to ten millions. And it is not unworthy of
remark, that this great increase of population in Ireland has taken
place since the introduction of the potatoe, which gives a never-failing
crop.</p>

<p>I am aware that such is not the common opinion which prevails
in this country, neither with regard to Ireland nor China; on the
contrary, the latter is generally supposed to be overstocked with
people; that the land is insufficient for their maintenance, and
that the cities stand so thick one after the other, especially along
the grand navigation between Pekin and Canton, that they almost
occupy the whole surface. I should not, however, have
expected to meet with an observation to this effect from the
very learned commentator on the <i>voyage of Nearchus</i>, founded
on no better authority than the crude notes of one <i>Æneas Anderson</i>,
a livery servant of Lord Macartney, vamped up by a
London bookseller as a speculation that could not fail, so greatly
excited was public curiosity at the return of the Embassy. I
would not be thought to disparage the authority on account of
its being that of a livery servant; on the contrary, the notes of
the meanest and dullest person, on a country so little travelled
over, would be deserving attention before they came into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
hands of a <i>book-dresser</i>; but what dependence can be placed on
the information of an author who states as a fact, that he saw tea
and rice growing on the banks of the <i>Pei-ho</i>, between the thirty-ninth
and fortieth parallels of latitude, two articles of the culture
of which, in the whole province of <i>Pe-tche-lee</i>, they know no
more than we do in England; and who ignorantly and impertinently
talks of the shocking ideas the Chinese entertained of
English cruelty, on seeing one of the guard receive a few lashes,
when, not only the common soldiers, but the officers of this nation
are flogged most severely with the bamboo on every slight
occasion. If Doctor Vincent, from reading this book, was
really persuaded that the cities of China were so large and so
numerous, that they left not ground enough to subsist the inhabitants,
I could wish to recall his attention for a few moments to
this subject, as opinions sanctioned by such high authority,
whether right or wrong, are sure, in some degree, to bias the
public mind. We have seen that if China be allowed to contain
three hundred and thirty-three millions of people, the proportion
of its population is only just double that of Great Britain.
Now if London and Liverpool and Birmingham and Glasgow,
and all the cities, towns, villages, gentlemen's villas, farm-houses
and cottages in this island were doubled, I see no great inconvenience
likely to arise from such duplication. The unproductive
land, in the shape of gentlemen's parks and pleasure grounds,
would, I presume, be much more than sufficient to counterbalance
the quantity occupied by the new erections; and the wastes
and commons would perhaps be more than enough to allow
even a second duplication. But the population of an English
city is not to be compared with, or considered as similar to, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
populousness of a Chinese city, as will be obvious by considering
the two capitals of these two empires. Pekin, according to
a measurement supposed to be taken with great accuracy, occupies
a space of about fourteen square miles. London, with its
suburbs, when reduced to a square, is said to comprehend about
nine square miles. The houses of Pekin rarely exceed a single
story; those of London are seldom less than four; yet both
the Chinese and the missionaries who are settled in this capital
agree that Pekin contains three millions of people; while London
is barely allowed to have one million. The reason of this
difference is, that most of the cross streets of a Chinese city are
very narrow, and the alleys branching from them so confined,
that a person may place one hand on one side and the other on
the other side as he walks along<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; that the houses in general
are very small, and that each house contains six, eight, or ten
persons, sometimes twice the number. If, therefore, fourteen
square miles of buildings in China contain three millions of
inhabitants, and nine square miles of buildings in England one
million, the population of a city in China will be to that of a
city in England as twenty-seven to fourteen, or very nearly
as two to one; and the former, with a proportion of inhabitants
double to that of the latter, will only have the same
proportion of buildings; so that there is no necessity of their
being so closely crowded together, or of their occupying so
great a portion of land, as to interfere with the quantity necessary
for the subsistence of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been thus particular, in order to set in its true light
a subject that has been much agitated and generally disbelieved.
The sum total of three hundred and thirty-three millions is so
enormous, that in its aggregate form it astonishes the mind and
staggers credibility; yet we find no difficulty in conceiving
that a single square mile in China may contain two hundred
and fifty-six persons, especially when we call to our recollection
the United Provinces of Holland, which have been calculated
to contain two hundred and seventy inhabitants on a square
mile. And the United Provinces have enjoyed few of the
advantages favourable to population, of which China, for ages
past, has been in the uninterrupted possession.</p>

<p>The materials for the statement given by Father Amiot of
the population of China appear to have been collected with
care. The number of souls in 1760, according to this statement</p>

<p>This statement must however be incorrect, from the circumstance
of some millions of people being excluded who have no
fixed habitation, but are constantly changing their position on
the inland navigations of the empire, as well as all the islanders
of the Archipelago of <i>Chu-san</i> and of Formosa. Without,
however, taking these into consideration, and by supposing the
number of souls in 1761, to amount to 198,214,553, there
ought to have been, in the year 1793, by allowing a progres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>sive
increase, according to a moderate calculation in political
arithmetic, at least 280,000,000 souls.</p>

<p>Whether this great empire, the first in rank both in extent
and population, may or may not actually contain 333 millions
of souls, is a point that Europeans are not likely ever to ascertain.
That it is capable of subsisting this and a much greater
population has, I think, been sufficiently proved. I know it is
a common argument with those who are not willing to admit
the fact, that although cities and towns and shipping may
be crowded together in an astonishing manner, on and
near the grand route between the capital and Canton, yet that
the interior parts of the country are almost deserted. By some
of our party going to <i>Chu-san</i>, we had occasion to see parts
of the country remote from the common road, and such parts
happened to be by far the most populous in the whole journey.
But independent of the small portion of country seen by us,
the western provinces, which are most distant from the grand
navigation, are considered as the granaries of the empire; and
the cultivation of much grain, where few cattle and less machinery
are used, necessarily implies a corresponding population.
Thus we see from the above table, that the surplus produce of
the land remitted to Pekin from the provinces of</p>

<p>chiefly in rice, wheat, and millet. There are no grounds therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
for supposing that the interior parts of China are deserts.</p>

<p>There are others again who are persuaded of the population
being so enormous, that the country is wholly inadequate to
supply the means of subsistence; and that famines are absolutely
necessary to keep down the former to the level of the
latter. The loose and general way in which the accounts of
the missionaries are drawn up certainly leave such an impression;
but as I have endeavoured to shew that such is far from
being the case, it may be expected I should also attempt to
explain the frequency of those disastrous famines which occasionally
commit such terrible havock in this country. I am of
opinion then, that three principal reasons may be assigned for
them. First, the equal division of the land: Secondly, the
mode of cultivation: and Thirdly, the nature of the products.</p>

<p>If, in the first place, every man has it in his option to
rent as much land as will support his family with food and
clothing, he will have no occasion to go to market for the first
necessities; and such being generally the case in China, those
first necessities find no market, except in the large cities. When
the peasant has brought under tillage of grain as much land as
may be sufficient for the consumption of his own family, and
the necessary surplus for the landlord, he looks no further; and
all his neighbours having done the same, the first necessities are,
in fact, unsaleable articles, except in so far as regards the demands
of large cities, which are by no means so close upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
one another as has been imagined. A surplus of grain is likewise
less calculated to exchange for superfluities or luxuries
than many other articles of produce. This being the case, if,
by any accident, a failure of the crops should be general in
a province, it has no relief to expect from the neighbouring provinces,
nor any supplies from foreign countries. In China there
are no great farmers who store their grain to throw into the
market in seasons of scarcity. In such seasons the only resource
is that of the government opening its magazines, and restoring
to the people that portion of their crop which it had demanded
from them as the price of its protection. And this being
originally only a tenth part, out of which the monthly subsistence
of every officer and soldier had already been deduced,
the remainder is seldom adequate to the wants of the people.
Insurrection and rebellion ensue, and those who may escape
the devouring scourge of famine, in all probability, fall by the
sword. In such seasons a whole province is sometimes half
depopulated; wretched parents are reduced, by imperious want,
to sell or destroy their offspring, and children to put an end,
by violence, to the sufferings of their aged and infirm parents.
Thus, the equal division of land, so favourable to population in
seasons of plenty, is just the reverse when the calamity of a
famine falls upon the people.</p>

<p>In the second place, a scarcity may be owing to the mode
of cultivation. When I mention that two-thirds of the small
quantity of land under tillage is cultivated with the spade or the
hoe, or otherwise by manual labour, without the aid of draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>-cattle
or skilful machinery, it will readily be conceived how
very small a portion each family will be likely to employ every
year; certainly not one-third part of his average allowance.</p>

<p>The third cause of famines may be owing to the nature of
the products, particularly to that of rice. This grain, the staff
of life in China, though it yields abundant returns in favourable
seasons, is more liable to fail than most others. A drought in
its early stages withers it on the ground; and an inundation,
when nearly ripe, is equally destructive. The birds and the
locusts, more numerous in this country than an European can
well conceive, infest it more than any other kind of grain. In
the northern provinces, where wheat, millet and pulse are
cultivated, famines more rarely happen; and I am persuaded
that if potatoes and Guinea corn (<i>Zea-Mays</i>) were once
adopted as the common vegetable food of the people, those
direful famines that produce such general misery would entirely
cease, and the encrease of population be as rapid as that of Ireland.
This root in the northern provinces, and this grain in
the middle and southern ones, would never fail them. An
acre of potatoes would yield more food than an acre of rice,
and twice the nourishment. Rice is the poorest of all grain, if we
may judge from the slender and delicate forms of all the people
who use it as the chief article of their sustenance; and potatoes
are just the contrary<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>As Dr. Adam Smith observes, "The chairmen, porters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
coal-heavers in London, and those unfortunate women who
live by prostitution, the strongest men and the most beautiful
women perhaps in the British dominions, are said to be,
the greater part of them, from the lowest rank of the people
in Ireland, who are generally fed with this root; no food
can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality,
or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human
constitution." The Guinea corn requires little or no attention
after the seed is dropped into the ground; and its leaves
and juicy stems are not more nourishing for cattle than its prolific
heads are for the sustenance of man.</p>

<p>Various causes have contributed to the populousness of
China. Since the Tartar conquest it may be said to have enjoyed
a profound peace; for in the different wars and skirmishes
that have taken place with the neighbouring nations on
the side of India, and with the Russians on the confines of
Siberia, a few Tartar soldiers only have been employed. The
Chinese army is parcelled out as guards for the towns, cities,
and villages; and stationed at the numberless posts on the roads
and canals. Being seldom relieved from the several guards,
they all marry and have families. A certain portion of land is
allotted for their use, which they have sufficient time to cultivate.
As the nation has little foreign commerce there are few
seamen; such as belong to the inland navigations are mostly
married. Although there be no direct penalty levied against
such as remain batchelors, as was the case among the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
when they wished to repair the desolation that their civil wars
had occasioned, yet public opinion considers celibacy as disgraceful,
and a sort of infamy is attached to a man who continues
unmarried beyond a certain time of life. And although
in China the public law be not established of the <i>Jus trium
liberorum</i>, by which every Roman citizen having three children
was entitled to certain privileges and immunities, yet every
male child may be provided for, and receive a stipend from the
moment of his birth, by his name being enrolled on the military
list. By the equal division of the country into small farms,
every peasant has the means of bringing up his family, if
drought and inundation do not frustrate his labour; and the
pursuits of agriculture are more favourable to health, and consequently
to population, than mechanical employments in
crowded cities, and large manufactories, where those who are
doomed to toil are more liable to become the victims of disease
and debauchery, than such as are exposed to the free and open
air, and to active and wholesome labour. In China there
are few of such manufacturing cities. No great capitals are
here employed in any one branch of the arts. In general
each labours for himself in his own profession. From the
general poverty that prevails among the lower orders of people,
the vice of drunkenness is little practised among them. The
multitude, from necessity, are temperate in their diet to the
last degree. The climate is moderate and, except in the
northern provinces where the cold is severe, remarkably uniform,
not liable to those sudden and great changes in temperature,
which the human constitution is less able to resist, than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
extremes of heat or cold when steady and invariable, and from
which the inconveniences are perhaps nowhere so severely
felt as on our own island. Except the small-pox and contagious
diseases that occasionally break out in their confined
and crowded cities, they are liable to few epidemical disorders.
The still and inanimate kind of life which is led by the women,
at the same time that it is supposed to render them
prolific, preserves them from accidents that might cause
untimely births. Every woman suckles and nurses her own
child.</p>

<p>The operation of these and other favourable causes that
might be assigned, in a country that has existed under the
same form of government, and preserved the same laws and
customs for so many ages, must necessarily have created an excess
of population unknown in most other parts of the world,
where the ravages of war, several times repeated in the course
of a century, or internal commotions, or pestilential disease, or
the effects of overgrown wealth, sometimes sweep away one
half of a nation within the usual period allotted to the life of
man.</p>

<p>"What a grand and curious spectacle," as Sir George Staunton
observes, "is here exhibited to the mind of so large a proportion
of the whole human race, connected together in one
great system of polity, submitting quietly and through so
considerable an extent of country to one great sovereign; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
uniform in their laws, their manners, and their language; but
differing essentially in each of these respects from every other
portion of mankind; and neither desirous of communicating
with, nor forming any designs against, the rest of the world."
How strong an instance does China afford of the truth of the
observation, that men are more easily governed by opinion than
by power.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">e</span> had no sooner passed the summit of the high mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
<i>Me-lin</i>, and entered the province of <i>Quan-tung</i>, or Canton, than
a very sensible difference was perceived in the conduct of the inhabitants.
Hitherto the Embassy had met with the greatest respect
and civility from all classes of the natives, but now even
the peasantry ran out of their houses, as we passed, and bawled
after us <i>Queitze-fan-quei</i>, which, in their language, are opprobrious
and contemptuous expressions, signifying <i>foreign devils</i>,
<i>imps</i>; epithets that are bestowed by the enlightened Chinese on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
all foreigners. It was obvious, that the haughty and insolent
manner in which all Europeans residing at, or trading to, the
port of Canton are treated, had extended itself to the northern
frontier of the province, but it had not crossed the mountain
<i>Me-lin</i>; the natives of <i>Kiang-see</i> being a quiet, civil, and inoffensive
people. In <i>Quan-tung</i> the farther we advanced, the more
rude and insolent they became. A timely rebuke, however,
given to the governor of <i>Nau-sheun-foo</i> by <i>Van-ta-gin</i>, for applying
the above mentioned opprobrious epithets to the British
Embassy, had a good effect on the Canton officers, who were
now to be our conductors through their province.</p>

<p>This contempt of foreigners is not confined to the upper ranks,
or men in office, but pervades the very lowest class who, whilst
they make no scruple of entering into the service of foreign
merchants residing in the country, and accepting the most menial
employments under them, performing the duties of their
several offices with diligence, punctuality, and fidelity, affect,
at the same time, to despise their employers, and to consider
them as placed, in the scale of human beings, many degrees below
them. Having one day observed my Chinese servant busily
employed in drying a quantity of tea-leaves, that had already
been used for breakfast, and of which he had collected
several pounds, I inquired what he meant to do with them:
he replied, to mix them with other tea and sell them. "And
is that the way," said I, "in which you cheat your own
countrymen?" "No," replied he, "my own countrymen are
too wise to be so easily cheated, but your's are stupid enough
to let serve you such like tricks; and indeed," continued he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
with the greatest <i>sang froid</i> imaginable, "anything you get
from us is quite good enough for you." Affecting to be angry
with him, he said, "he meant for the <i>second sort</i> of Englishmen,"
which is a distinction they give to the Americans<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>The city of <i>Nan-sheun-foo</i> was pleasantly situated on the high
bank of the river <i>Pei-kiang-ho</i>. The houses appeared to be
very old, the streets narrow, large tracts of ground within the
walls unbuilt, others covered with ruins. While the barges
were preparing to receive on board the baggage, we took up
our lodgings in the public temple, that was dedicated to the
memory of Confucius, being, at the same time, the college
where the students are examined for their different degrees. It
consisted of a long dark room, divided by two rows of red
pillars into a middle and two side aisles, without furniture, paintings,
statues, or ornaments of any kind, except a few paper
lanterns suspended between the pillars; the floor was of earth,
and entirely broken up: to us it had more the appearance of a
large passage or gang-way to some manufactory, as a brewhouse
or iron foundery, than of the hall of Confucius. On each side,
and at the farther extremity, were several small apartments, in
which we contrived to pass the night.</p>

<p>The barges in which we now embarked were very small,
owning to the shallowness of the river. The officers, assembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>here from different parts of the country, detained us a whole
day in order to have an opportunity of laying their several
complaints before our physician, at the recommendation of <i>Van-ta-gin</i>,
who had felt the good effects of his practice. Here, for
once, we had an instance of Chinese pride giving way to self-interest,
and usurped superiority condescending to ask advice of
barbarians. We sailed for two days in our little barges, through
one of the most wild, mountainous, and barren tracts of country
that I ever beheld, abounding more in the sublime and horrible,
than in the picturesque or the beautiful. The lofty summits
of the mountains seemed to touch each other across the
river and, at a distance, it appeared as if we had to sail through
an arched cavern. The massy fragments that had fallen down
from time to time, and impeded the navigation, were indications
that the passage was not altogether free from danger. Five
remarkable points of sand-stone rock, rising in succession above
each other with perpendicular faces, seemed as if they had
been hewn out of one solid mountain: they were called <i>ou-ma-too</i>,
or the five horses' heads. The mountains at a distance on
each side of the river were covered with pines, the nearer hills
with coppice wood, in which the Camellia prevailed; and in
the little glens were clusters of fishermen's huts, surrounded by
small plantations of tobacco.</p>

<p>Within the defile of these wild mountains, we observed several
extensive collieries, which were advantageously worked
by driving levels from the river into their sides. The coals
brought out of the horizontal <i>adits</i> were immediately lowered
from a pier into vessels that were ready to receive and trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>port
them to the potteries of this province, and of <i>Kiang-see</i>.
Coal is little used in its raw state, but is first charred in large pits
that are dug in the ground. Coal dust, mixed with earth, and
formed into square blocks, is frequently used to heat their little
stoves, on which they boil their rice.</p>

<p>At the city of <i>Tchao-tchoo-foo</i>, where we arrived on the 13th,
we exchanged our flat-bottomed boats for large and commodious
yachts, the river being here much increased by the confluence
of another stream. The boats before this city were
mostly managed by young girls, whose dress consisted of a neat
white jacket and petticoat and a gipsey straw hat. Having for
so great a length of time scarcely ever set our eyes upon a female,
except the heads of some at a distance, peeping from behind
the mud walls that surround the houses, or labouring in
the grounds of <i>Kiang-see</i>, the ferry girls, though in reality very
plain and coarse-featured, were considered as the most beautiful
objects that had occurred in the whole journey. To the occupation
of ferrying passengers over the river it seemed they
added another, not quite so honourable, for which, however,
they had not only the consent and approbation of their parents,
but also the sanction of the government, or perhaps, to speak
more correctly, of the governing magistrates, given in consideration
of their receiving a portion of the wages of prostitution.</p>

<p>In this mountainous district a few fishermen's huts and
those of the colliers were the only habitations that occurred;
but the defect of population was abundantly supplied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
number of wooden dwellings that were floating on the river.
Small huts, to the number of thirty or forty, were sometimes
erected upon a single floating raft of fir baulks, lashed together
by the ends and the sides. On these rafts the people carry on
their trade or occupation, particularly such as work in wood.</p>

<p>Our conductors directed the yachts to halt before a detached
rock, rising with a perpendicular front from the margin of the
river to the height of seven hundred feet. In this front we observed
a cavern, before which was a terrace that had been cut
out of the rock, accessible by a flight of steps from the river.
Proceeding from the terrace into the cavity of the rock, we
ascended another flight of stairs, also cut out of solid stone,
which led into a very spacious apartment. In the centre of
this apartment sat the goddess <i>Poo-sa</i> upon a kind of altar, constituting
a part of the rock, and hewn into the shape of the
<i>Lien-wha</i> or Nelumbium. A small opening, next the river, admitted
a "dim religious light," suitable to the solemnity of
the place, which we were told was a temple consecrated to
<i>Poo-sa</i>, and a monastery for the residence of a few superannuated
priests. On the smooth sides of the apartment was inscribed a
multitude of Chinese verses, some cut into the rock, and others
painted upon it. The lodgings of the priests were small caves
branching out of the large temple. A third flight of steps led
from this to a second story, which was also lighted by a small
aperture in front, that was nearly choaked up by an immense
mass of stalectite that had been formed, and was still increasing,
by the constant oozing of water holding in solution calcareous
matter, and suspended from a projection of the upper part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
of the rock. But the light was sufficient to discover a gigantic
image with a Saracen face, who "grinn'd horrible a ghastly
smile." On his head was a sort of crown; in one hand he
held a naked scymeter, and a firebrand in the other; but the
history of this colossal divinity seemed to be imperfectly known,
even to the votaries of <i>Poo-sa</i> themselves. He had in all probability
been a warrior in his day, the Theseus or the Hercules of
China. The cave of the Cumæan Sibyl could not be better
suited for dealing out the mysterious decrees of fate to the superstitious
multitude, than that of the <i>Quan-gin-shan</i>, from
whence the oracle of future destiny, in like manner,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 35%;">
<div class="poem">
"Horrendas canit ambages, antroque remugit,<br />
Obscuris vera involvens."<br />
<br />
"The wond'rous truths, involv'd in riddles, gave,<br />
And furious bellow'd round the gloomy cave."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Lord Macartney observed that this singular temple brought
to his recollection a Franciscan monastery he had seen in Portugal,
near Cape Roxent, usually called the <i>Cork Convent</i>, "which
is an excavation of considerable extent under a hill, divided
into a great number of cells, and fitted up with a church,
sacristy, refectory, and every requisite apartment for the accommodation
of the miserable Cordeliers who burrow in it.
The inside is entirely lined with cork: the walls, the roofs,
the floors, are covered with cork; the tables, seats, chairs,
beds, couches, the furniture of the chapel, the crucifixes, and
every other implement, are all made of cork. The place was
certainly dismal and comfortless to a great degree, but it
wanted the gigantic form, the grim features, the terrific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
aspect which distinguish the temple of <i>Poo-sa</i>, in the rock of
<i>Quan-gin-shan</i>." Dismal as this gloomy den appeared to be,
where a few miserable beings had voluntarily chained themselves
to a rock, to be gnawed by the vultures of superstition
and fanaticism, it is still less so than an apartment of the Franciscan
convent in Madeira, the walls of which are entirely covered
with human skulls, and the bones of legs and arms,
placed alternately in horizontal rows. A dirty lamp suspended
from the ceiling, and constantly attended by an old bald-headed
friar of the order, to keep the feeble light just glimmering in
the socket, serves to shew indistinctly to strangers this disgusting
<i>memento mori</i>. It would be difficult to determine which of
the three were the most useless members of society, the monks
of <i>Poo-sa</i>, the monks of the Cork convent, or the monks of
Golgotha.</p>

<p>In several places among the wild and romantic mountains
through which we were carried on this river, we noticed quarries
of great extent, out of which huge stones had been cut for
sepulchral monuments, for the arches of bridges, for architraves,
for paving the streets, and for various other uses. To obtain
these large masses, the saw is applied at the upper surface, and
they work down vertically to the length required. Each
stone is shaped and fashioned to the size that may be wanted,
before it is removed from the parent rock, by which much
difficulty is avoided and less power required in conveying it
to its destination. Rude misshapen blocks, requiring additional
labour for their removal, are never detached from the rock in
such a state. In this respect they are more provident than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
late Empress of Russia who, at an immense expense and with
the aid of complicated machinery, caused a block of stone to
be brought to her capital, to serve as a pedestal for the statue
of the Czar Peter, where it was found expedient to reduce it to
two-thirds of its original dimensions.</p>

<p>Between the city of Canton and the first pagoda on the bank
of the river, there is a continued series of similar quarries, which
appear not to have been worked for many years. The regular and
formal manner in which the stones have been cut away, exhibiting
lengthened streets of houses with quadrangular chambers, in the
sides of which are square holes at equal distances, as if intended
for the reception of beams; the smoothness and perfect perpendicularity
of the sides, and the number of detached pillars that
are scattered over the plain, would justify a similar mistake to
that of Mr. Addison's Doctor of one of the German universities,
whom he found at Chateau d'Un in France, carefully
measuring the free-stone quarries at that place, which he had
conceived to be the venerable remains of vast subterranean palaces
of great antiquity.</p>

<p>Almost all the mountains that occurred in our passage through
China were of primæval granite, some few of sand-stone, and
the inferior hills were generally of lime-stone, or coarse grey
marble. Except the Ladrone islands on the south, and some
of the <i>Chu-san</i> islands on the east, we observed no appearances
in the whole country of volcanic productions. The high
mountains, indeed, that form great continental chains are
seldom, if ever, of volcanic formation. The presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
vast volume of water seems to be indispensably necessary to
carry on this operation of nature and, accordingly, we find
that volcanic mountains are generally close to the sea coast, or
entirely insulated. Thus, although a great part of the islands
on the coast of China are volcanic, we met with no trace of
subterranean heat, either in volcanic products or thermal
springs, on the whole continent. Yet earthquakes are said to
have been frequently felt in all the provinces, but slight and of
short duration.</p>

<p>About seven miles to the southward of the temple in the rock,
the mountains abruptly ceased, and we entered on a wide extended
plain which, to the southward and on each side, was
terminated only by the horizon. This sudden transition from
barrenness to fertility, from the sublime to the beautiful, from
irregularity to uniformity, could not fail to please, as all strong
contrasts usually do. The country was now in a high state of
tillage; the chief products were rice, sugar-canes, and tobacco;
and the river was so much augmented by the tributary
streams of the mountains, which we had just left behind,
that it was nearly half a mile in width. Canals branched
from its two banks in every direction. At the city of <i>San-shwee shien</i>,
we observed the current of the river receding, being
driven back by the flux of the tide.</p>

<p>On the 10th, we halted before a village which was just within
sight of the suburbs of Canton. Here the Embassador was
met by the Commissioners of the East India Company, whom
the Chinese had allowed to proceed thus far from the factory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
and to which place the servants of the Company are occasionally
permitted to make their parties of pleasure. In the neighbourhood
of this village are extensive gardens for the supply
of the city with vegetables. In some we observed nurseries for
propagating the rare, the beautiful, the curious, or the useful
plants of the country; which are sent to Canton for sale. On
this account we were not sorry to be obliged to spend the
remainder of the day at this place. Among the choice plants
we noticed the large <i>Peonia</i> before mentioned, white, red, and
variegated; the elegant <i>Limodorum Tankervilliæ</i>, and that singular
plant the <i>Epidendrum flos aeris</i> so called from its vegetating
without the assistance of earth or water; the <i>Hybiscus mutabilis</i>,
the <i>Abelmoschus</i>, and other species of this genus; the double
variegated <i>Camellia Japonica</i>; the great holly-hock; the scarlet
<i>amaranthus</i> and another species of the same genus, and a
very elegant <i>Celosia</i> or cock's comb; the <i>Nerium Oleander</i>,
sometimes called the Ceylon rose, and the <i>Yu-lan</i>, a species of
magnolia, the flowers of which appear before the leaves burst
from the buds. Of the scented plants the <i>plumeria</i> and a
double flowering jasmine were the most esteemed. We observed
also in pots the <i>Ocymum</i> or sweet Basil, <i>Cloranthus inconspicuous</i>,
called <i>Chu-lan</i>, whose leaves are sometimes mixed with
those of tea to give them a peculiar flavour; the <i>Olea fragrans</i>,
or sweet scented olive, said also to be used for the same purpose;
a species of myrtle; the much esteemed <i>Rosa Sinica</i>; the
<i>Tuberose</i>; the strong scented <i>Gardenia florida</i>, improperly called
the Cape Jasmine; the China pink and several others, to enumerate
which would exceed the limits of this work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>Of fruits we noticed a variety of figs, and three species of
mulberries; peaches and almonds; the <i>Annona</i> or custard-apple;
the <i>Eugenia Jambos</i>, or rose-apple; the much-esteemed
<i>Lee-tchee</i> or <i>Sapindus-edulis</i>; and the <i>K&oelig;lreuteria</i>, another species
of the same genus; the <i>Averhoa Carambola</i>, an excellent
fruit for tarts; and the <i>Ou-long-shoo</i>, the <i>Sterculia platanifolia</i>.
Besides these were abundance of oranges and bananas.</p>

<p>As vegetables for the table, was a great variety of beans and
calavances, among which was the <i>Dolichos Soja</i> or soy plant,
and the <i>polystachios</i>, with its large clusters of beautiful scarlet
flowers; the <i>Cytisus Cadjan</i>, whole seed yields the famous bean-milk,
which it is the custom of the Emperor to offer to Embassadors
on their presentation; large mild radishes, onions,
garlic, <i>Capsicum</i> or Cayenne-pepper; <i>convolvulus batatas</i>, or
sweet potatoes; two species of tobacco; <i>Amomum</i>, or ginger, in
great quantities, the root of which they preserve in syrup;
<i>Sinapis</i>, or mustard, and the <i>Brassica orientalis</i>, from which an oil
is expressed for the table.</p>

<p>Of plants that were useful in the arts, we observed the <i>Rhus
vernix</i>, or varnish-tree, and two other species of the same genus;
<i>Curcuma</i>, or turmeric; <i>Carthamus</i> used as a dye, and the <i>polygonum
Chinense</i> for the same purpose; the <i>Rhapis flabelliformis</i>, the
dried leaves of which are used for fans among the common
people, and particularly by those who live in vessels; <i>Corchorus</i>
whose bark, in India, is used as flax; but not, I believe,
to any extent in China, the white nettle being here preferred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
The only medicinal plants were the <i>Rheum palmatum</i>, <i>Artemisia</i>,
and the <i>Smilax</i> or China root.</p>

<p>To make our <i>entré</i> into Canton the more splendid, a number
of superb barges were sent to meet us, carrying flags and
streamers and umbrellas and other insignia of office; and in some
were bands of music. About the middle of the day we arrived
before the factories, which constitute a line of buildings in the
European style, extending along the left bank of the river,
where the Embassador was received by the <i>Song-too</i>, or Viceroy,
the Governor, the <i>Ho-poo</i>, or collector of the customs, and
all the principal officers of the government. From hence we
were conducted to the opposite side of the river, where a temporary
building of poles and mats had been prepared for the
occasion; within which was a screen of yellow silk bearing the
name of the Emperor in gilt characters. Before this screen
the Viceroy and other officers performed the usual prostrations,
in token of gratitude to his imperial Majesty, for his having
vouchsafed us a prosperous journey.</p>

<p>It is but doing justice to the Chinese government and to the
individuals in its employ who had any concern in the affairs of
the embassy, to observe, that as far as regarded ourselves, their
conduct was uniformly marked by liberality, attention, and an
earnest desire to please. Nor is there any vanity in saying that,
after observing us closely in the course of a long journey and
daily intercourse, the officers of government gradually dismissed
the prejudices imbibed against us, as foreigners, from their earliest
youth. Gained by our frank and open manners, and by little
attentions, they seemed to fly with pleasure to our society as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
relief from the tedious formalities they were obliged to assume
in their official capacity. <i>Van</i> and <i>Chou</i> constantly passed the
evenings in some of our yachts. It is impossible to speak of
those two worthy men in terms equal to their desert. Kind,
condescending, unremitting in their attentions, they never betrayed
one moment of ill-humour from the time we entered
China till they took their final leave at Canton. These two men
were capable of real attachments. They insisted on accompanying
the Embassador on board the Lion, where they took
their last farewell. At parting they burst into tears and
shewed the strongest marks of sensibility and concern. Their
feelings quite overcame them, and they left the Lion sorrowful
and dejected. Early the following morning they sent
on board twenty baskets of fruit and vegetables, as a farewell
token of their remembrance. We had the satisfaction to hear,
that immediately on their arrival at Pekin they both were promoted.
<i>Chou</i> is at present in a high situation at court, but <i>Van</i>,
the cheerful good-humoured <i>Van</i>, has paid the debt of nature,
having fallen honourably in the service of his country. On
the conduct of <i>Lee</i>, our Chinese interpreter, any praise that
I could bestow would be far inadequate to his merit. Fully
sensible of his perilous situation, he never at any one time
shrank from his duty. At Macao he took an affectionate leave
of his English friends, with whom, though placed in one of
the remotest provinces of the empire, he still contrives to correspond.
The Embassador, Lord Macartney, has had several
letters from him; the last of which is of so late a date as March
1802; so that his sensibility has not been diminished either by
time or distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the custom of China to consider all Embassadors as guests
of the Emperor, from the moment they enter any part of his
dominions, until they are again entirely out of them. The inconvenience
of this custom was severely felt by us, as it prevented
us from purchasing, in an open manner, many trifling
articles that would have been acceptable. The very considerable
expence, incurred by the court on this account, may be one
reason for prescribing the limited time of forty days for all embassadors
to remain at the capital. To meet the expences of
the present Embassy, <i>Van-ta-gin</i> assured me, that they were furnished
with an order to draw on the public treasuries of the
different provinces through which we had to pass, to the amount
of five thousand ounces of silver a-day, or about one thousand
six hundred pounds sterling: and that fifteen hundred ounces
a-day had been issued out of the treasury at Pekin for the support
of the Embassy during its continuance there. Supposing
then these data to be correct, and I see no reason for calling
their authenticity in question, we may form an estimate of the
whole expence of this Embassy to the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Or one hundred and seventy-three thousand pounds sterling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
three Chinese ounces being equal to one pound sterling.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible that this enormous sum of money could
have been expended on account of the Embassy, though I
have no doubt of its having been issued out of the Imperial
treasury for that purpose. One of the missionaries informed
me, in Pekin, that the Gazette of that capital contained an article
stating the liberality of the Emperor towards the English
Embassador, in his having directed no less a sum than fifteen
hundred ounces of silver to be applied for the daily expences of
the Embassy, while stationary in the capital and at Gehol. The
same gentleman made an observation, that the great officers of
government, as well as those who had the good luck to be appointed
to manage the concerns of a foreign embassy, considered
it as one of the best wind-falls in the Emperor's gift, the
difference between the allowances and the actual expenditure
being equivalent to a little fortune.</p>

<p><i>Van-ta-gin</i>, indeed, explained to us, that although the Imperial
warrant was signed for those sums, yet that having a number
of offices to pass through, in all of which it diminished a
little, the whole of it was not actually expended on the Embassy.
He gave to the Embassador an excellent illustration of
the manner in which the Imperial bounty was sometimes applied.
An inundation had swept away, the preceding winter,
a whole village in the province of <i>Shan-tung</i>, so suddenly, that
the inhabitants could save nothing but their lives. The Emperor
having once lodged at the place immediately ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
100,000 ounces of silver for their relief, out of which the first
officer of the treasury took 20,000, the second 10,000, the
third 5,000, and so on, till at last there remained only 20,000
for the poor sufferers. So that the boasted morality of China
is pretty much the same, when reduced to practice, as that of
other countries.</p>

<p>The real expence, however, of the British Embassy, could
not have been a trifle, when we consider what a vast multitude
of men, horses, and vessels were constantly employed on the
occasion. <i>Van-ta-gin</i> assured me, that there were seldom fewer
than one thousand men, and frequently many more, employed
one way or other in its service; and I am persuaded he did not
intend to exaggerate. In the first place, from the mouth of the
<i>Pei-ho</i> to <i>Tong-tchoo</i>, we had forty-one yachts or barges, each
on an average, including boatmen, trackers, and soldiers, having
on board fifteen men; this gives six hundred and fifteen
men to the boats only. Caterers running about the country to
collect provisions, boatmen to bring them to the several barges,
the conducting officers, and their numerous retinue, are not
included in this estimate. From <i>Tong-tchoo</i> near three thousand
men were employed to carry the presents and baggage, first to
<i>Hung-ya-yuen</i>, beyond Pekin, and then back again to the capital,
which took them three days. In our return from <i>Tong-tchoo</i>
to <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>, we had a fleet of thirty-vessels, with ten
men at least and, for the greatest part of the journey, twenty
additional trackers to each vessel; this gives nine hundred
people for the yachts alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>From <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i> to <i>Eu-shan-shien</i> and from <i>Hang-tchoo-foo</i>
to <i>Chu-san</i>, there might probably be employed about forty vessels,
with twelve men to each, or four hundred and eighty in the
whole. And, besides the people employed by the officers of
government to purchase provisions, numbers were stationed in
different parts of the rivers to contract the stream, by raking
together the pebbles where, otherwise, the water would have
been too shallow for the boats to pass; and others to attend
at all the fluices on the canals to assist the vessels in getting
through the same.</p>

<p>From <i>Tchang-shan-shien</i> to <i>Eu-shan-shien</i>, overland, we had
about forty horses, and three or four hundred men to carry the
baggage.</p>

<p>From the <i>Po-yang</i> lake to Canton, we had generally about
twenty-six vessels with twenty men to each, including boatmen,
soldiers, and trackers, which gives five hundred and twenty
men for these alone.</p>

<p>The Embassy consisted of near one hundred persons, but as
for the several officers and their numerous retinue of guards, attendants,
and runners, I have not the least idea to what their
numbers might amount; all of whom, being on extraordinary
service, were supported at the public expence.</p>

<p>The whole expence of the Embassy to this country, including the
presents, did not exceed eighty thousand pounds; an inconsiderable
sum for such a nation as Great Britain on such an occasion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
not more than a fourth part of what has been generally imagined.</p>

<p>Although the British factory was in every sense more comfortable
than the most splendid palace that the country afforded,
yet it was so repugnant to the principles of the government for
an Embassador to take up his abode in the same dwelling with
merchants, that it was thought expedient to indulge their notions
in this respect, and to accept a large house in the midst of
a garden, on the opposite side of the river, which was fitted up and
furnished with beds in the European manner, with glazed sash windows,
and with fire grates suitable for burning coals. On our arrival
here we found a company of comedians hard at work, in the
middle of a piece, which it seemed had begun at sun-rise; but their
squalling and their shrill and harsh music were so dreadful, that
they were prevailed upon, with difficulty, to break off during dinner,
which was served up in a viranda directly opposite the theatre.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, about sun-rise, they set to work
afresh, but at the particular request of the Embassador, in
which he was joined by the whole suite, they were discharged,
to the no small astonishment of our Chinese conductors, who
concluded, from this circumstance, that the English had very
little taste for elegant amusements. Players, it seems, are here
hired by the day and the more incessantly they labour, the
more they are applauded. They are always ready to begin
any one piece out of a list of twenty or thirty, that is presented
for the principal visitor to make his choice.</p>

<p>The nature of the trade carried on by foreign nations at the
port of Canton is so well known, that it would be superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
for me to dwell on that subject. The complaints of all nations
against the extortions practised there have been loudly and frequently
heard in Europe, but the steps that have hitherto been
taken have proved unavailing. The common answer is,
"Why do you come here? We take in exchange your articles
of produce and manufacture, which we really have no
occasion for, and give you in return our precious tea, which
nature has denied to your country, and yet you are not satisfied.
Why do you so often visit a country whose customs you
dislike? We do not invite you to come among us, but when
you do come, and behave well, we treat you accordingly.
Respect then our hospitality, but don't pretend to regulate or
reform it." Such is the language held to Europeans by all
the petty officers of government with whom they have to
deal.</p>

<p>With such sentiments one cannot be surprized that foreign
merchants should be received with indifference, if not
handled with rudeness, and that the fair trader should be liable
to extortions. This is still more likely to happen from the
complete monopoly of all foreign trade being consigned to a
limited number of merchants, seldom, I believe, exceeding
eight, who are sanctioned by government. The cargoes of tin,
lead, cotton, opium, and large sums of Spanish dollars, sent to
Canton from Europe, India, and America, all pass through the
hands of these Hong merchants, who also furnish the return cargoes.
As the capital employed is far beyond any thing of the kind
we can conceive in Europe by so few individuals, their profits must
be proportionally great, or they could not be able to bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
expence of the numerous and magnificent presents which they
are expected to make to the superior officers of government at
Canton, who, in their turn, find it expedient to divide these with
the Emperor and his ministers in the capital. The various
toys, automatons, moving and musical figures from Coxe's museum,
the mathematical and astronomical instruments, clocks,
watches, machinery, jewellery, all made in London, and now
in the different palaces of the Emperor of China, are said to be
valued at no less a sum than two millions sterling, all presents
from Canton. The principal officers of this government are
invariably sent down from Pekin; they arrive poor and, in
the course of three years, return with immense riches. How
much of the enormous wealth of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i> came from
the same quarter it is difficult to say, but the great influence he
possessed over the Emperor, and his intimacy with the viceroy
of Canton, who was superseded in 1793, leave no doubt,
that a very considerable part of it was drawn from this port.
The large pearl, which forms one of the charges preferred
against him, was a present from Canton, of which I have been
told a curious history by a gentleman who was on the spot at the
time it happened. An Armenian merchant brought this pearl to
Canton, in the expectation of making his fortune. Its size and
beauty soon became known and attracted the attention of the
officers and the merchants, who paid their daily visits to the
Armenian, offering him prices far inadequate to its value. At
length, however, after minute and repeated examinations, a
price was agreed upon and a deposit made, but the Armenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
was to keep possession of the pearl till the remaining part
of the purchase-money should be ready; and in order to obviate
any possibility of trick, the box in which it was kept was sealed
with the purchaser's seal. Several days elapsed without his
hearing any thing further from the Chinese; and, at length,
the time approached when all foreign merchants are ordered
down to Macao. The Armenian, in vain, endeavoured to find
out the people who had purchased his pearl, but he contented
himself with the reflection that, although he had been disappointed
in the main object of his journey, he still had his
property, and that the deposit was more than sufficient to defray
his expences. On reaching his home, he had no longer
any scruple in breaking open the seal; but his mortification may
easily be supposed, on discovering that his real pearl had
been exchanged for an artificial one, so very like as not to be
detected but by the most critical examination. The daily visits
of these people, it seems, were for no other purpose than to enable
them to forge an accurate imitation, which they had dexterously
substituted for the real one, when they proposed the
cunning expedient of sealing the box in which it was inclosed.
The Armenians, however, were determined not to be outdone
by the Chinese. A noted character, of the name of <i>Baboom</i>,
equally well known in Bengal and Madras as in Canton, just
before his failure in about half a million sterling, deposited a valuable
casket of pearls, as he represented them, in the hands of
one of the <i>Hong</i> merchants, as a pledge for a large sum of
money, which, when opened, instead of pearls was found to
be <i>a casket of peas</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>It has always been considered that a foreigner has little chance
of obtaining justice at Canton. The import and export duties,
which by the law of the country ought to be levied <i>ad valorem</i>,
are arbitrarily fixed according to the fancy of the collector.
And although the court is at all times ready to punish, by confiscation
of their property, such as have been guilty of corruption
and oppression, yet by accepting their presents, it seems to
lend them its encouragement. Besides, the distance from Canton
to the metropolis is so great, the temptations so strong, and
the chances of impunity so much in their favour, that to be
honest, when power and opportunity lend their aid to roguery,
is a virtue not within the pale of Chinese morality. A striking
instance of their peculation appeared in a circumstance that
was connected with the British Embassy. In consideration of
the Hindostan having carried presents for the Emperor, an order
was issued from Court that she should be exempt from
duties at any of the ports where she might take in a cargo. It
happened that the Hong merchants had already paid the Hindostan's
duties with those of the other ships, of which her particular
share was 30,000 ounces of silver. The <i>Hoo-poo</i> or collector
was therefore requested to return this sum agreeably to
the order from court, but he refunded only into Mr. Browne's
hands 14,000 dollars, which can be reckoned as little more
than 11,000 ounces, observing, that so much was the exact
amount of the Emperor's duties. As in this instance of a public
nature the collector could not be supposed to act without circumspection,
we may conclude how very small a proportion
of the duties, extorted from foreigners trading to Canton, finds
its way into the Imperial treasury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the taxes, which, if we may judge of them from
those paid by their own countrymen, are extremely moderate,
by the abuses of the administration become serious grievances
to the foreign merchant who, however, has never hitherto employed
the only probable mean of obtaining redress&mdash;that of
making himself acquainted with the language of the country,
so as to be able to remonstrate to the high officers of state,
against the oppressions and impositions of those who act in inferior
capacities; for, however rapacious and corrupt the first
in authority may be, his timid nature would shrink immediately
from a bold, clamorous, and able complainant, who possessed
the means of making his delinquency notorious. This
observation has been verified by a recent occurrence. A fraudulent
suppression of a bankruptcy, for which the government
stood responsible, and by which the interests of the East India
Company, as well as of several individuals in India and Canton,
would materially have suffered, was completely frustrated
by the simple circumstance of Mr. Drummond, the chief of
the factory, rushing into the city of Canton, and repeating
aloud a few words which he had got by heart whilst, at the
same time, he held up a written memorial; the consequence
of which was, that the memorial was immediately carried to
the viceroy, and the grievance complained of therein redressed.
It would have been in vain to convey it through any of the inferior
officers or the Hong merchants, as they were all interested
in keeping it from the knowledge of government.</p>

<p>The supposed difficulty of acquiring the Chinese language
has hitherto intimidated the residents in Canton from making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
the attempt. Satisfied in transacting the Company's concerns
through the medium of a jargon of broken English, which all
the Hong merchants and even the inferior tradesmen and mechanics
find it worth their while to acquire, they have totally
neglected the language, as well as every other branch of information
respecting the most interesting and extraordinary empire
on the face of the globe. The attainment in fact of four or
five thousand characters, which are sufficient to write clearly
and copiously on any subject, is much less difficult than usually
has been imagined, but it would require great attention and
unremitting perseverance, such perhaps as few are willing to
bestow, who are placed in situations which enable them to
calculate, almost to a certainly, on realizing a fixed sum in a
given number of years. The climate may also be adverse to
intense application, but if the foundation was laid in England,
much of the difficulty would thus be obviated. The French,
aware of the solid advantages that result from the knowledge of
languages, are at this moment holding out every encouragement
to the study of Chinese literature; obviously not
without design. They know that the Chinese character is understood
from the Gulph of Siam to the Tartarian Sea, and
over a very considerable part of the great Eastern Archipelago;
that the Cochin Chinese, with whom they have already firmly
rooted themselves, use no other writing than the pure Chinese
character, which is also the case with the Japanese. It is to be
hoped therefore that the British nation will not neglect the
means of being able to meet the French, if necessary, even on
this ground. The method of accomplishing this desirable object
appears to be extremely simple. If the Directors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
East India Company were to make it a rule that no writer
should be appointed to China until he had made himself acquainted
with five hundred or a thousand characters of the
language<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, I will be bold to say that, where the number sent
out is so few (the establishment not exceeding twenty) and
the emoluments so very liberal, there would be as little danger
as at present, by such a regulation, of the appointments being
made out of their own families. The noble Marquis at the
head of their affairs in India has established an institution,
which seems to bid fair for producing a mutual benefit to
the parent state and the native Indians. The exertions of Sir
William Jones and a few others had, indeed, long before
this, been productive of the happiest effects; and great numbers,
both on the civil and military establishments of the Company,
made themselves acquainted, in a certain degree, with
the different languages spoken in the country. In fact, it became
a matter of necessity, in order to remove prejudices imbibed
against us and to meet those of the natives. The Portuguese
and the Dutch adopted a different policy; and, like
our residents at Canton, communicated only with the natives
in a jargon of their own languages. Mr. Thunberg tells a
story of a Dutch gentleman, who had resided as chief of their
factory in Japan for fourteen years, during which period he
had been four times in the capacity of Embassador to the court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>yet, on being asked the name of the Emperor of Japan, freely
avowed that it had never occurred to him to ask it. In fact,
his grand object was the accumulation of so many millions of
florins in a given time; in the pursuit of which he had completely
lost sight of the Emperor of Japan and his millions of
subjects.</p>

<p>If then, by neglecting to study the language of the Chinese,
we are silly enough to place ourselves and concerns so completely
in their power, we are highly deserving of the extortions
and impositions so loudly complained of. If the trade of
London was exclusively vested in the hands of <i>eight merchants</i>,
and if the foreigners who visited its port could neither speak
nor write one single word of the language of England, but
communicated solely on every subject with those eight merchants,
through a broken jargon somewhat resembling the
languages of the several foreigners, it might fairly be questioned,
without any disparagement to the merchants of London,
if those foreigners would have less reason of complaint
than the Europeans have who now trade to China? Even as
things are, would a Chinese arriving in England find no subject
of complaint, no grievances nor vexations at the custom-house,
which, for want of knowing our language, he might be apt
to consider as extortions and impositions? Two years ago two
Chinese missionaries landed in England, in their way to the
college <i>de propaganda Fide</i> at Naples. Each had a small bundle
of clothes under his arm and, according to the custom of
their country, a fan in his hand. Being observed by one of
those voracious sharks who, under the pretext of preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
frauds on the revenue, plunder unprotected foreigners and
convert the booty to their own advantage, the poor fellows
were stripped by him of the little property they carried in their
hands, and were not, without difficulty, allowed to escape with
the clothes on their backs. Can we blame these people for
representing us as a barbarous, unfeeling, and inhospitable
nation, however undeserving we may be of such a character?</p>

<p>Our case at Canton is pretty nearly the same as that of the
two Chinese missionaries. Every petty officer of the government
knows he can practise impositions on our trade with impunity,
because we have not the means of bringing his villainy
to the knowledge of his superiors. For, how great soever
may be the propensity of the Chinese people to fraud and
extortion, I have little doubt of the justice and moderation
of the Chinese government, when the case is properly represented.
A recent circumstance may be mentioned in support
of this opinion. In the year 1801, a sailor on board his
Majesty's ship the Madras fired upon and mortally wounded a
Chinese who was passing in a boat. A discussion, as usual,
took place with the Chinese government; but it was conducted
in a very different manner from what had hitherto been usual
on similar occasions. Instead of entering into any explanation
or defence through the medium of the Hong merchants, who
tremble at the lowest officer of government, a memorial was
addressed to the Viceroy, drawn up in a proper and becoming
manner by the present Sir George Staunton, the only Englishman
in the Company's service who was skilled in the Chinese language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
Several conversations were also held on the subject with the
officers of justice, from which the Hong merchants were excluded.
Captain Dilkes setting up a plea of recrimination
on the ground of some Chinese having cut his cable with an
intent to steal it, the government assented to have the matter
tried in the supreme court of justice in the city of Canton. By
the law of China, if the wounded person survive forty days,
the sentence of death is commuted for that of banishment into
the wilds of Tartary; yet so favourably did the court incline
to the side of the accused in this instance, that although the
time was not expired, and there was little hope of the wounded
man recovering, they allowed Captain Dilkes to take the seaman
into his own custody, requiring only that he should leave
in court a written promise to produce him in case the wounded
should not survive the time prescribed by law. The man
lingered near fifty days and then died, upon which a message
was sent by the court, intimating to the Captain, that the
court saw no impropriety, in this instance, in leaving it to him
to punish the delinquent according to the laws of his own
country; thus, for the first time, assenting to set aside a positive
law in favour of foreigners. By this proper mode of
interference an English subject was saved from an unjust and
ignominious death, which would otherwise inevitably have happened,
as on all former occasions of a similar kind, had the affair
been left in the hands of men whose interest it is to represent
us as barbarians, and who, however well they might be disposed,
have not the courage to plead our cause. Hitherto the
Chinese have invariably made a point of executing immediately,
and without a regular trial, any foreigner who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
kill a Chinese, or some substitute in the place of the actual criminal,
as I have already instanced in the seventh chapter. One
of the most intelligent of the East India Company's servants at
Canton, speaking on this subject, in answer to certain queries
proposed to him about the time of the Embassy, remarks, "I
cannot help observing, that the situation of the Company's
servants and the trade in general is, in this respect, very
dangerous and disgraceful. It is such that it will be impossible
for them to extricate themselves from the cruel dilemma
a very probable accident may place them in, I will not say
with <i>honour</i>, but without <i>infamy</i>, or exposing the whole
trade to ruin." Yet we have just now seen, on the recurrence
of such an accident, that by the circumstance of a direct
and immediate communication with the government, the affair
was terminated, not only without disgrace or infamy, but in a
that was honourable to both parties.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">CONCLUSION.</h2>
<hr style="width: 6%; margin-top: -.25em; margin-bottom: 2em;" />


<p>I have now gone over most of the points relative to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
which I have been able to recollect the remarks and observations
which arose in my mind during my attendance on this
memorable Embassy. The comparisons I have made were
given with a view of assisting the reader to form in his own
mind some idea what rank the Chinese may be considered to
hold, when measured by the scale of European nations; but
this part is very defective. To have made it complete would
require more time and more reading, than at present I could
command. The consideration of other objects, those of a political
nature, which are of the most serious importance to our
interests in China, is more particularly the province of those in
a different sphere, and would, therefore, be improper for me to
anticipate or prejudge, by any conjectures of my own. It belongs
to other persons, and perhaps to other times<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; but it is to
be hoped that the information, reflections, and opinions of the
Embassador himself, may one day be fully communicated to the
public, when the present objections to it shall cease, and the
moment arrive (which is probably not very distant) that will
enable us to act upon the ideas of that nobleman's capacious and
enlightened mind, and to prove to the world that the late Embassy,
by shewing the character and dignity of the British na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>tion
in a new and splendid light, to a court and people in a
great measure ignorant of them before, however misrepresented
by the jealousy and envy of rivals, or impeded by the
counteraction of enemies, has laid an excellent foundation for
great future advantages, and done honour to the wisdom and
foresight of the statesman<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> who planned the measure, and directed
its execution.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Monsieur (I beg his pardon) <i>Citoyen</i> Charpentier Cossigny.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This expression alludes to the ancient opinion that China was surrounded by the sea,
and that the rest of the world was made up of islands. Yet though they now possess a
tolerable notion of geography, such is their inveterate adherence to ancient opinion, that
they prefer retaining the most absurd errors, rather than change one single sentiment or
expression that Confucius has written.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The expence occasioned to the court of China by the British embassy, will be
stated in a subsequent chapter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In the very next page (202) he however corrects himself, by observing that <i>either</i>
the Chinese or Malays navigated as far as Madagascar.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> If any argument were wanting to prove the originality of the magnetic needle as
used in China, the circumstance of their having ingrafted upon it their most ancient and
favourite mythology, their cycles, constellations, elements, and, in short, an abstract of
all their astronomical or astrological science, is quite sufficient to settle that point. Those
who are acquainted with the Chinese character will not readily admit that their long
established superstitions should be found incorporated on an instrument of barbarian invention.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I should not have taken notice of this odious vice, had not the truth of its existence
in China been doubted by some, and attributed by others to a wrong cause.
Professing to describe the people as I found them, I must endeavour to draw a faithful
picture, neither attempting to palliate their vices, nor to exaggerate their
virtues.</p></div>

comparisons between the Chinese and other languages, I here subjoin a short list of
words in the former, expressing some of the most striking objects in the creation, a
few subjects of natural history, and of such articles as from their general use are familiar
to most nations, these being of all others the most likely to have retained
their primitive names. The orthography I have used is that of the English language.

<p>I must observe, however, for the information of these philologists, that scarcely
two provinces in China have the same oral language. The officers and their attendants
who came with us from the capital could converse only with the boatmen of
the southern provinces, through the medium of an interpreter. The character of the
language is universal, but the name or sound of the character is arbitrary. If a <i>convention
of sounds</i> could have been settled like a convention of marks, one would suppose
that a commercial intercourse would have effected it, at least in the numeral
sounds, that must necessarily be interchanged from place to place and myriads of
times repeated from one corner of the empire to the other. Let us compare
then the numerals of Pekin with those of Canton, the two greatest cities in
China.

<p>If then, in this highly civilized empire, the oral language of the northern part differs
so widely from the southern that, in numerous instances, by none of the etymological
tricks<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> can they be brought to bear any kind of analogy; if the very word
which in Pekin implies the number <i>one</i>, be used in Canton to express <i>two</i>, how very absurd
and ludicrous must these learned and laboured dissertations appear, that would
assign an oriental origin to all our modern languages?</p></div>

Mr. Webbe thinks that the derivation of the Greek <ins title="gynê">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052;</ins> <i>a woman</i>, from the Chinese <i>na-gin</i>, is self-evident.</p></div>

of the present Sir George Staunton having not only acquired, in little more

topics of conversation, but he also learned to write the characters with such facility
and accuracy, that all the diplomatic papers of the Embassy addressed to the Chinese
government were copied by him (the Chinese themselves being afraid to let papers
of so unusual a style appear in their own hand-writing) in so neat and expeditious
a manner as to occasion great astonishment. It may be observed, however, that

the Spaniards, in the year 1342, or 1343, as quoted by Bishop Watson, observes,
"that the Moors very much annoyed the Christians with their iron shot;" and he
further adds, that "this is the first mention made in history of the use of gunpowder
and ball." It is therefore extremely probable, that the first introduction of
gunpowder into Europe was by some Mahomedans from the eastward, and that
Schwartz was not the inventor, although he might perhaps have been the first
publisher of the discovery.</p></div>

port of Canton, which have generally led to disagreeable discussions with the Chinese
government, the supercargoes of the East India Company thought proper, on a late
occasion of a person being wounded by a shot from a British ship of war, to make
application for an extract from the criminal code of laws relating to homicide, in order
to have the same translated into English, and made public. This extract consisted
of the following articles:
</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><p>1. A man who kills another on the supposition of theft, shall be strangled, according
to the law of homicide committed in an affray.
</p><p>
2. A man who fires at another with a musquet, and kills him thereby, shall be beheaded,
as in cases of wilful murder. If the sufferer be wounded, but not mortally,
the offender shall be sent into exile.
</p><p>
3. A man who puts to death a criminal who had been apprehended, and made no
resistance, shall be strangled, according to the law against homicide committed in
an affray.
</p><p>
4. A man who falsely accuses an innocent person of theft (in cases of greatest criminality)
is guilty of a capital offence; in all other cases the offenders, whether principals
or accessaries, shall be sent into exile.
</p><p>
5. A man who wounds another unintentionally shall be tried according to the law
respecting blows given in an affray, and the punishment rendered more or less severe,
according to the degree of injury sustained.
</p><p>
6. A man who, intoxicated with liquor, commits outrages against the laws, shall be
exiled to a desert country, there to remain in a state of servitude.</p></div>
<p>
In this clear and decisive manner are punishments awarded for every class of
crimes committed in society; and it was communicated to the English factory from
the viceroy, that on no consideration was it left in the breast of the judge to extenuate
or to exaggerate the sentence, whatever might be the rank, character, or station of
the delinquent.</p></div>

of the transaction appear to have been enquired into fairly and impartially,
and no pains spared to ascertain the exact degree of criminality. Being given to me
about the time when the trial took place of Smith, for the murder of the supposed

cases, and with the almost identical defence set up by the Chinese and the English

<div class="center"><i>Translation of an Extract from a Collection of Chinese Law Reports, being the Trial, Appeal,
and Sentence upon an Indictment for Homicide by Gun firing.</i></div>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">
At a criminal court held in the province of Fo-kien, upon an indictment for shooting,
and mortally wounding a relation; setting forth, that <i>She-fo-pao</i>, native of the
city of <i>Fo-ngan-sien</i>, did fire a gun, and by mischance, wound <i>Vang-yung-man</i>, so that he
died thereof.
</p><p>
The case was originally reported, as follows, by <i>Vu-se-Kung</i>, sub-viceroy of the province
of Fo-kien:
</p><p>
The accused <i>She-fo-pao</i>, and the deceased <i>Vang-yung-man</i>, were of different families,
but connected by marriage, were well known to each other, and there had always
been a good understanding between them.
</p><p>
In the course of the first moon, of the 25th year of <i>Kien-long</i>, <i>She-fo-pao</i> cultivated
a farm on the brow of a hill belonging to <i>Chin-se-kien</i>, and which lay in the vicinity
of certain lands cultivated by <i>Vang-yung-man</i> and <i>Vang-ky-hao</i>, inasmuch as that the
fields of <i>Vang-yung-man</i> lay on the left of those of <i>She-fo-pao</i>, which were in the center,
and those of <i>Vang-ky-hao</i> on the right side of the declivity of the hill. It occurred
that on the 7th day of the 9th moon of the same year, <i>She-fo-pao</i> observing
the corn in his fields to be nearly ripe, was apprehensive that thieves might
find an opportunity of stealing the grain; and being aware, at the same time, of the
danger which existed on those hills from wolves and tygers, armed himself with a
musquet, and went that night alone to the spot, in order to watch the corn, and seated
himself in a convenient place on the side of the hill. It happened that <i>Vang-ky-hao</i>
went that day to the house of <i>Vang-yung-man</i>, in order that they might go together
to keep watch over the corn in their respective fields. However <i>Vang-yung-tong</i> the
elder brother of <i>Vang-yung-man</i>, conceiving it to be yet early, detained them to drink
tea, and smoke tobacco until the second watch<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of the night, when they parted from
him, and proceeded on their expedition, provided with large sticks for defence.
</p><p>
<i>Vang-ky-hao</i> having occasion to stop for a short time upon the road, the other <i>Vang-yung-man</i>
went on before, until he reached the boundary of the fields watched by
<i>She-fo-pao</i>.
</p><p>
<i>She-fo-pao</i>, on hearing a rustling noise among the corn, and perceiving the shadow
of a person through the obscurity of the night, immediately hailed him, but the wind
blowing very fresh, he did not hear any reply. <i>She-fo-pao</i> then took alarm, on the
suspicion that the sound proceeded from thieves, or else from wild beasts, and lighting
the match-lock, which he held in his hand, fired it off, in order to repel the invaders
whoever they might be.
</p><p>
<i>Vang-yung-man</i> was wounded by the shot in the head, cheeks, neck, and shoulder,
and instantly fell to the ground. <i>Vang-ky-hao</i> hearing the explosion, hastened forward,
and called aloud to enquire who had fired the gun. The other heard the
voice, and going to the place from whence it proceeded, then learned whom he had
wounded by the mischance. The wounds of <i>Vang-yung-man</i> being mortal, he expired
after a very short interval of time had elapsed.
</p><p>
<i>She-fo-pao</i>, being repeatedly examined by the magistrate, acknowledged the fact
without reserve, and, upon the strictest investigation and enquiry being entered upon,
deposed, That it was really during the obscurity of the night that he had ascended
the hill, in order to watch the corn, and on hearing a noise proceed from a quarter
of the field that was extremely dark, and in which the shadow of some person
was discernable, he had called out, but received no answer:&mdash;That the suspicion then
arose in his mind, that they were either thieves or wild beasts, and alarmed him for
the security of his person, being then entirely alone, he therefore fired the gun to repel
the danger, and wounded <i>Vang-yung-man</i> by mischance, so that he afterwards
died.
</p><p>
That he, the deponent, was not actuated by any other motive or intention on this
occasion, nor desirous of causing the death of an individual. The relations of the
deceased being then examined, give a corresponding evidence, and raised no doubts
in other respects to the truth of the above deposition. In consideration, therefore,
hereof it appears that, although <i>She-fo-pao</i> is guilty of homicide by gun-firing, yet,
since he was upon the watch over the fields, in the darkness of the night, and perceived
the shadow of a man, whom he hailed, and from whom he received no answer,
and had in consequence apprehended the approach of thieves or wild beasts, to prevent
which, he fired the gun that occasioned the wounds whereof the man is now
dead&mdash;It follows, that there did not exist any premeditated intention of murder.&mdash;The
act of which <i>She-fo-pao</i> stands convicted may be, therefore, ranked under the article
of homicide committed in an affray, and the sentence accordingly is, to be
strangled upon the next ensuing general execution or gaol delivery.
</p><p>
The above report being transmitted to the supreme criminal tribunal at Pekin,&mdash;They
rejoin,
</p><p>
That, on investigation of the laws we find it ordained, that homicide by gun-firing
shall receive a sentence conformable to the law against intentional murder; and that
the law against intentional murder gives a sentence of decapitation on the next ensuing
public execution, or gaol delivery. It is likewise found to be ordained by law,
that whoever shall unwarily draw a bow, and shoot an arrow towards fields or tenements,
so that any person unperceived therein shall be wounded, and die therefrom,
the offender shall receive a hundred blows with the bamboo, and be banished to the
distance of three thousands lys (near a thousand miles).
</p><p>
In the case now before us, <i>She-fo-pao</i>, being armed with a musquet, goes to watch
the corn, hears a noise in the fields, and calls aloud, but, receiving no answer, suspects
it to proceed from thieves or wild beasts, and fires the gun, by which <i>Vang-yung-man</i>
was wounded, and is now dead. But in the deposition given in by the defendant,
the declaration that he saw the shadow of some person does not accord
with the suspicion afterwards expressed, that the noise arose from wild beasts. If, in
truth, he distinguished traces of a man, at the time of his calling out, notwithstanding
that the violence of the wind prevented his hearing the reply, <i>She-fo-pao</i> had ocular
proof of the reality of the person from the shadow he had seen. Continuing our investigation,
we have further to notice, that when <i>She-fo-pao</i> took his station in order to
guard the middle ground, <i>Vang-yung-man</i> was engaged in watching his fields in a similar
manner, and would have occasion to go near the limits of the middle ground
in his way to his own farm, and which could not be far removed from the path
leading to the middle ground; on which account it behoved <i>She-fo-pao</i> to hail the
person repeatedly, previous to the firing of the gun, whose effect would be instantaneous,
and occasion the death of the unknown person from whom the sound proceeded.
</p><p>
<i>She-fo-pao</i> not having repeatedly hailed the person from whom the noise had arisen
to disturb him, and proceeding to the last extremity upon the first impulse or alarm,
are grounds for suspecting that there exists a fallacy and disguise in the testimony
given in this affair, in which case, a sentence conformable to the law against homicide,
committed in an affray, would afford a punishment unequal and inadequate to
the possible aggravation of the offence.
</p><p>
On the other hand, it would appear, in confirmation of his statement, that these
fields were, according to the custom of the neighbouring villages, understood to be
guarded at that time in a the manner aforesaid, and that circumstance proving true,
the accident that followed might still be considered solely as the effect of apprehension
of wild beasts by night, inducing the accused to fire towards fields or tenements,
so as to wound a man mortally by the mischance.
</p><p>
Should a strict examination admit of this interpretation of the offence, the sentence
may be awarded according to the law, immediately applicable to the subject, and
not in conformity with the law against homicide committed in an affray. As the
life or death of the offender rests on the preference to be shewn towards either of
those expositions of the case, it is resolved to hold any immediate decision as premature,
and we issue our directions to the said sub-viceroy to revise the prior decision;
and, with the assistance of a renewed investigation, finally to determine and report to
us the sentence which he may conceive most agreeable to the spirit of our laws.
</p><p>
After a second investigation, and reconsideration of the affair, the sub-viceroy
sent in the following report to the supreme tribunal: Pursuant to the order
for revisal issued by the supreme criminal tribunal, <i>She-fo-pao</i> has been again examined
at the bar, and deposes, That on hearing a noise in the corn fields, he
conceived it to proceed from thieves, and called out in consequence, but, receiving
no answer, and finding the noise gradually to approach him, he then
suspected it to have arisen from a wolf or tyger; and, in the alarm thus excited for
his personal safety, had fired the gun, by which <i>Vang-yung-man</i> had been mortally
wounded; That, since the event happened in the second watch of the night, after the
moon had set, and while clouds obscured the faint light of the stars, it was really a
moment of impenetrable darkness; and that it was only at the distance of a few
paces that he distinguished the approach of the sound that had alarmed him, but, in
fact, had never seen any shadow or traces whatsoever; That he had perceived any
traces or shadow of that description, he would not have ceased to call out, though
he had failed to receive an answer the first time, nor would he have had the temerity
to fire the gun, and render himself guilty of murder.
</p><p>
That, on the preceding examination, the severity and rigour of the enquiry regarding
the grounds upon which he suspected the approach of thieves, so as to induce
him to fire, had overcome him with fear, being a countryman unused to similar
proceedings, and produced the apparent incongruity in his deposition, but that
the true meaning and intent was to express his absolute uncertainty whether the
alarm arose from thieves or wild beasts and nothing farther, and that from
such deposition he had never intentionally swerved in the course of the investigation.
</p><p>
According, therefore, to the amendment suggested by the supreme tribunal, it
appears indeed, that when the noise was first perceived in the fields, <i>She-fo-pao</i> had
called out, and on being prevented by the wind from hearing a reply, had taken
alarm as aforesaid.
</p><p>
And whereas it was likewise deposed by <i>She-fo-pao</i>, That the grain being ripe at that
season, the stems were exceeding high and strong, so as to render it difficult to walk
amongst them, it seems that <i>Vang-yung-man</i>, in walking through the corn, had produced
a rustling noise very audible to <i>She-fo-pao</i>, who was sitting on the declivity
of the hill, and in a direction in which the wind favoured the progress of the sound;
but when the latter called out, the wind, on the contrary, prevented him from being
heard, and consequently from receiving an answer; this mischance, therefore,
gave rise to his suspicion of the approach of wild beasts, which appears to have been
the sole and undisguised motive for firing the gun.
</p><p>
This statement of facts being narrowly investigated, in compliance with the supreme
tribunal's order for revisal, may be confided in as accurate, and worthy of
credit; the result, therefore, is that the offender during the darkness of the night,
and under the apprehension of the approach of a wolf or tyger, had fired a musquet
in a spot frequented by men, and had mortally wounded a man by the mischance,
which corresponds with the law suggested in the order for revisal issued by the supreme
tribunal; namely, that law against an offender who should unwarily draw a
bow and shoot an arrow towards fields or tenements, so that any person unperceived
therein should be wounded and die therefrom.
</p><p>
The prior decision, conformably to the law against homicide committed in an
affray, subsequent investigation does not confirm; and <i>She-fo-pao</i> is, therefore, only
punishable with banishment.
</p><p>
This second report being received by the supreme criminal tribunal, they declare
that,
</p><p>
The sentence having been altered on a revision by the sub-viceroy, and rendered
conformable to the law, which ordains that, whoever shall unwarily draw a bow and
shoot an arrow towards fields or tenements, so that any person unperceived therein
may be wounded, and die therefrom, the offender shall receive a hundred blows
with the bamboo, and suffer banishment to the distance of 3000 lys.</p>

<p>We confirm the sentence of a hundred blows of the bamboo, and banishment to
the distance of 3000 lys; and further prescribe, that ten ounces of silver (3<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>)
shall be paid by the offender to the relations of the deceased for the expences of
burial.</p>

<p>The sentence, being thus pronounced on the 19th day of the 5th moon, of the
27th year of <i>Kien-Long</i>, received the Imperial sanction on the 21st day of the same
moon, in the following words: Pursuant to sentence be this obeyed.</p>

in its true light, the despotic nature of the Chinese government, notwithstanding
their salutary laws. The new Emperor, determined on his ruin, makes a public declaration
wherein, after apologizing for not abstaining agreeably to the laws of the
empire from all acts of innovation, for the space of three years after his father's
death, he observes, that the crimes and excesses of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i> are of so horrid a
nature, as to preclude him from acting towards him with any pity or indulgence.
He then exhibits about twenty articles of accusation against him, the principal of
which are,
</p><p>
<i>Contumacy</i> towards his father (the late Emperor) by riding on horseback to the
very door of the hall of audience at <i>Yuen-min-yuen</i>.
</p><p>
<i>Audacity</i>, under pretence of lameness, in causing himself to be carried to and from
the palace through the door set apart for the Emperor.
</p><p>
<i>Scandalous behaviour</i>, in taking away the virgins of the palace, and appropriating
them to his own use.
</p><p>
<i>Pride and insolence</i>, in countermanding his (the new Emperor's) order, for all the
princes of Tartary to be summoned to Pekin, those who had not had the small-pox
excepted, to assist at the funeral of his father, and by issuing a new one, in which
<i>none</i> were excepted.
</p><p>
<i>Bribery and partiality</i>, in selling and giving away appointments of weight to persons
totally unqualified to fill them.
</p><p>
<i>Arrogance</i>, in making use of the wood <i>Nan-moo</i> (cedar) in his house, which is destined
exclusively for royal palaces; and in building a house and gardens in the style
and manner of those belonging to the Emperor.
</p><p>
For having in his possession more than two hundred strings of pearls, and an immense
quantity of jewels and precious stones, which his rank did not allow him to wear,
and among which was a pearl of such wonderful magnitude, that the Emperor himself
had no equal to it.
</p><p>
For having in gold and silver alone, which has been already discovered and confiscated,
the amount, at least, of ten million taels (about 3,300,000<i>l.</i> sterling).
</p><p>
One article is singularly curious. For having been guilty of the deepest treachery
in informing him (the new Emperor) of his father's intention to abdicate the government
in his (the new Emperor's) favour, <i>one day</i> before his father made it public,
thinking by such means to gain his favour and affection!
</p><p>
After enumerating the several articles of accusation, the Emperor states, that this
minister being interrogated by a Tartar prince on several points, had confessed
the whole to be true, and, therefore, without further evidence, he commands the
presidents and members of the several courts in Pekin, the viceroys of provinces, and
governors of cities, on these articles of accusation being laid before them, to pass a
proper sentence on the said <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>. According to the majority, he was condemned
to be beheaded; but as a peculiar act of grace and benevolence on the part
of the Emperor, this sentence was mitigated to that of his being allowed to be his
own executioner. A silken cord being sent as an intimation of this mark of the Emperor's
favour, he caused himself to be strangled by some of his attendants.
</p><p>
Who could escape when the Emperor of China is himself the accuser? It will readily
occur, from the fate of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>, that there is not that line of independence
drawn between the executive and juridical authority, which the ingenious author of the
Spirit of Laws has clearly proved to be the grand foundation of a just, legal, and
efficient security of the life and property of the subject. In fact, in all state crimes,
the Emperor becomes both the accuser and the judge. In the case of <i>Ho-tchung-tang</i>
he may likewise be said to have been the only evidence.</p></div>

Westminster Abbey, a shrewd churchman is said to have observed to the Abbot of
Westminster, "If you don't take care to destroy that machine, it will very soon destroy
your trade." He saw at a single glance of the press, the downfal of priestly
dominion in the general diffusion of knowledge that would be occasioned by it, and
had the rest of the clergy been equally clear-sighted, it is probable the dark ages of
superstition and ignorance had still continued, or at least had been greatly protracted.</p></div>

propagated among the eastern nations, by means of French emissaries; when one
of those assiduous disturbers of the peace of mankind had actually succeeded in furnishing
the Seiks with an abstract of this precious work in their own language, he next
turned his attention to the vast empire of China, a glorious theatre for those zealous
cosmopolites to play their parts in, if they could once contrive to suit their drama to
the taste of the people. The experiment, however, failed of success. The golden
opinions of <i>Tom Paine</i> could not be transfused into the Chinese language; and these
unfortunate people understood no other but their own; so that three hundred and
thirty-three millions were doomed to remain in ignorance and misery on account of
their language being incapable of conveying the enlightened doctrines of <i>Tom Paine</i>.</p></div>

an alarming nature. A very serious rebellion had broken out in the western provinces,
which had extended to that of Canton, the object of which was the overthrow
of the Tartar government. It was known for some years past, as I before observed,
that certain secret societies were forming in the different provinces, who corresponded
together by unknown signs, agreed upon by convention, but they were not considered
to be of that extent as to cause any uneasiness to the government. It appears, however,
that not fewer than forty thousand men had assembled in arms in the province
of Canton, at the head of whom was a man of the family of the last Chinese Emperor,
who had assumed the Imperial Yellow. These rebels, it seems, are considerably
encouraged in their cause by a prophesy, which is current among the people,
that the present Tartar dynasty shall be overturned in the year 1804. The existence
of such a prophecy may be more dangerous to the Tartar government than the arms
of the rebels, by assisting to bring about its own accomplishment.</p></div>

whose fleeting sounds have never been fixed by any graphic invention, makes it the
more surprizing how Lord Kames, in his sketch on the origin and progress of American
nations, after observing that no passage by land had been discovered between
America and the old world, should have given it as his opinion, that an enquiry,
much more decisive at to the former being peopled by the latter, might be pursued,
by ascertaining whether the same language be spoken by the inhabitants on the two
sides of the strait that divides the northern regions of America from Kamskatka.
And that, after finding this not to be the case, he should conclude that the former
could not have been peopled by the latter. Had not Lord Kames written upon a
system of a separate and local creation, pre-established in his own mind, he would
unquestionably have laid more stress upon a resemblance in their physical characters,
in their superstitions and religious notions, than on similarity of language; which,
among the many acquirements of the human species, or of human institution, is not
the least liable to change by a change of situation, especially where no written character
has been employed to fix it. His Lordship's conclusion is the more extraordinary,
as he had already observed that the resemblance between them was perfect
in every other respect.</p></div>

make the following observation. "To the southward of the <i>Cossack</i> country a horde

It certainly cannot be inferred that by the <i>Seres</i>, in any of the above quotations, was
meant the same people as the present Chinese; on the contrary, the probability is
that it did not allude to this nation, and that the ancients had not the least knowledge
of its existence. It appears from another passage in Pliny, that the best iron in
the world was in <i>Sericum</i>, and that the Seres exported it with their cloths and skins.
The iron of the Chinese, as I have had occasion to observe, is remarkably bad, and
all their articles of peltry are imported.</p></div>

to these Israelites. We had hitherto entertained a hope of being able to procure,
in the course of our journey, a copy of this ancient monument of the Jewish
history, which the late Doctor Geddes considered as very desirable to compare with
those already in Europe; but the hasty manner in which we travelled, and the repugnance
shewn by our conducting officers, <i>Chou</i> and <i>Van</i> excepted, who had little
power or influence in the provinces, to enter into any of our views that might appear
to occasion delay, prevented the fulfilment of those hopes. It were much to be
wished, that the reverend missionaries would so far lay aside their antipathy against
opinions, not exactly coinciding with their own, and enter into such a correspondence
with the Jews, as would obtain from them, which they are no doubt possessed of, an
account of the progress made by the Chinese in civilization and arts, since their first
settling in that country, and of other particulars noted down by them. The circumstance
of their carrying with them their code of laws, and the history of their tribes,
is a sufficient proof that they understood a written language which there can be no
doubt, they would use the utmost caution not to lose. Such an account would be
more authentic than the Chinese annals, the best of which abound in hyperbole, and
contain facts so disguised in metaphor, that it is no easy matter to extract from them
the simple truth. At all events, the comparison of the two histories would serve to
verify each other.</p></div>

out of prison, who, being detected in privately seducing the Chinese from the religion
and customs of the country, had been condemned to perpetual imprisonment.
This edict, of which I procured a copy in Pekin, does great honour to the humane
and benevolent mind of the Emperor. After stating their crime, apprehension,
and trial, he observes, "Had they made known their arrival to the officers of
government, they might have proceeded to the capital and found protection.
But as transgressors of the law, which forbids the entrance of strangers, they have
stolen into the country, and secretly endeavoured to multiply converts to their
way of thinking, it became my duty to oppose a conduct so deceitful, and to put
a stop to the progress of seduction. Justly as they were found to deserve the
punishment to which they have been condemned, touched, nevertheless, with
compassion for their imprudence, it was not without injury to my feelings that I ratified
the sentence. But recollecting afterwards that they were strangers&mdash;strangers
perhaps ignorant of the laws of my empire, my compassion increased for them,
and humanity suffers on account of their long confinement. I will, therefore,
and command that these twelve strangers be set at liberty."</p></div>

of astronomers, who pretend to predict events, and cast out evil spirits by a charm,
consisting of some character written by them, according to the supposed prevailing
planet. The national almanack, not less minute in its predictions than those of
Francis Moore or Vincent Wing, or even Partridge, points out the changes of the
weather in every month, with the lucky and unlucky days for undertaking most of
the important concerns of life. And that the fallacy of these is not detected, may
afford less matter for surprize, on recollection that, in the wise and enlightened countries
of Europe, and among very intelligent people, the state of the weather is pretended
to be predicted by the phases of the moon, that is to say, they will prognosticate
a change of weather to happen at the new moon, or the first quarter, or the full,
or the last quarter, or, at all events, three days before, or three days after one or
other of these periods; so that the predictor has, at the least, eight and twenty days
out of a lunar revolution, in favour of his prediction being right, and the whole
lunation is only twenty-nine and a half. He has also another great advantage: the
accidental coincidence of one single prophecy with the event, establishes his fame
for ever, whilst his blunders are either overlooked, or considered only as those of the
person, and not the defect of the science.</p></div>

the Dutch Embassadors were conveyed to and from the capital in the middle of
winter. The inconveniences they suffered on this occasion are such as can scarcely
be conceived to have happened in a civilized country. The perusal of the manuscript
journal I have elsewhere noticed conveyed to my mind the idea of a country
dreary and desolate, and of a people indigent and distressed; without humanity, and
without hospitality. They travelled in little bamboo chairs, carried by four men,
who were generally so weak and tottering that they could not go through the day's
journey, but were obliged, frequently, in the middle of the night, to halt in an open
uninhabited part of the country, where not a hovel of any description was to be met
with to shelter them from the inclemency of the weather. And it most commonly
happened, that the lodgings appointed for their reception, at the different stages were
in such a miserable condition, admitting on every side the wind, rain, or snow, that
they generally preferred taking a little rest in their bamboo chairs. They were surprized
to find so few cities, towns, or villages in their route, and not less surprized at the
ruinous condition in which these few appeared to be. Near the capital a whole city exhibited
only a mass of ruins. In many places they found the country under water,
and the mud hovels completely melted down. Sometimes they passed extensive
wastes, where not a trace was visible of any kind of cultivation, nor a single dwelling
occurred in the distance of eight or ten English miles. And it was not before they
had crossed the Yellow River that they perceived the marks of wheel-carriages imprinted
on the roads, which were so little travelled upon that they could with difficulty
be traced. Here they met old men and young women travelling in wheelbarrows;
and litters carried by asses, one being fixed between the poles before, and
one behind. The rivers had no bridges over them; and such as were too deep to
be forded, they were under the necessity of crossing on rafts of bamboo. In short,
before they arrived at the capital, the fatigue and hardships they had undergone
considerably impaired their health, and the condition of their clothing was such as
to excite the compassion of the mandarines, who made them a present of twenty
sheep-skin jackets, dressed with the wool upon them; which, like the Hottentots,
they wore inwards. One of these gentlemen assured me, that having satisfied his
curiosity, no earthly consideration should tempt him to undertake a second journey
by land to the capital; for that he believed the whole world could not furnish a like
picture of desolation and misery. What a contrast is here exhibited to the ease and
convenience with which our journey was made! But the whole treatment of the
Dutch embassy seems to have been proportioned to the degree of importance which
the Chinese attached to the political condition of this nation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> It may be observed of almost all the writings of the missionaries concerning China,
that virtues of so trifling a nature as hardly to deserve the name, have met their unqualified
praise, whilst enormous vices have either been palliated or passed over in
silence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> The water-wheels still used in Syria differ only from those of China, by
having loose buckets suspended at the circumference, instead of fixed tubes. "The
wheels of Hama," says Volney, "are thirty-two feet in diameter. Troughs are
fastened to the circumference, and so disposed as to fall in the river, and when
they reach the vertex of the wheel, discharge the water into a reservoir."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> The simple boiling of the water indeed contributes greatly to the quick deposition
of earthy particles, which may have been one cause of the universal practice of
drinking every thing warm in China. They were surprised to see our soldiers and
servants drinking the water of the Pei-ho cold, and told them it was very bad for
the stomach and bowels. This complaint, in fact, attacked almost all the inferior
part of the embassy, which Doctor Gillan did not hesitate to ascribe to the great impurity
of the water. But the Chinese argued the point with the Doctor with regard
to taking it cold, asking him why all the fluids of the body were warm, if nature
had intended us to drink water and other liquids in a cold state! They seemed
to have forgotten that all the warm-blooded animals, except man, must necessarily
drink cold water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> As these teas however were purchased by Chinese, I have no doubt they reserved
to themselves a very large profit on the commission, for it is scarcely possible that this
article, the growth and produce of the middle provinces, should bear a price so far
beyond what the very best sells for in London.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> An old Frenchman (<i>Cossigny</i>) but a disciple of the new school, has found out
that the Chinese are in possession of a new science, the existence of which was not
even suspected by the enlightened nations of Europe. As he has the merit of making
this wonderful discovery, it is but fair to announce it in his own words: "Je
pense que nous devrions prendre chez eux (les Chinois) les premiers elements de la
<i>spermatologie</i>, science toute nouvelle pour l'Europe, science qui intéresse l'humanité
en général, en lui procurant des jouissances qui l'attachent à son existence, en entretenant
la santé et la vigeur, en réparant l'abus des excès, en contribuant à l'augmentation
de la population. Il feroit digne de la sollicitude des gouvernemens de
s'occuper des recherches qui pourroient donner des connoissances sur une science
à peine soupçonnée des peuples éclairés de l'Europe." He then announces his
knowledge in preparing "des petites pastilles qui sont aphrodisiaques et qui conviennent
sur-tout aux veillards, et à ceux qui ont fait des excès:" and he concludes
with the mortifying intelligence that he is not permitted to reveal the important
secret, "qui intéresse l'humanité en general."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> In the tenth volume of a very extensive agricultural work, is detailed the whole
process of cultivating the cotton from the seed to the web. The author observes,
"The cotton in its raw state affords a light and pleasant lining for clothes; the seed
yields an oil, which, being expressed from them, the remainder is serviceable as
manure; the capsules or pods, being hard and woody, are used for firing, and the
leaves afford nourishment to cattle, so that every part of the vegetable may be appropriated
to some useful purpose.
</p><p>
"The soil most favourable to this plant is a white sand, with a small proportion of
clay or loam. The plant affects an elevated open situation, and cannot endure low
marshy grounds.
</p><p>
"After all the cotton pods are gathered, the remaining stems and branches
should be cleared away without loss of time, and the ground carefully ploughed up,
to expose a new surface to the air and renew the vigour of the soil.
</p><p>
"When the plough has passed through the ground three times, the earth should be
raked level, that the wind may not raise or dry up any part of it.
</p><p>
"&mdash;&mdash;When there is an abundance of manure, it may be laid on previous to
the use of the plough, but if it be scarce, &amp;c. it will be preferable to apply it to the
soil at the time of sowing the seed.
</p><p>
"The manure should be old and well prepared, and among the best ingredients for
the purpose, is the refuse of vegetable substances, from which an oil has been expressed.
</p><p>
"In the southern provinces the cotton plant will last for two or three years, but to
the northward the seed must be sown annually."
</p><p>
The author then enumerates nine distinct varieties and their comparative qualities;
after which he proceeds to the choice of seed, under which head he observes,
that if the seed be steeped in water, in which <i>eels</i> have been boiled, the plant will resist
the attack of insects. He then describes the three methods of broadcast, drilling, and
dibbling, and gives a decided preference of the last, though it be the most laborious.
</p><p>
"The ground being well prepared, holes are to be made at the distance of a cubit
from each other, and the lines a cubit apart. A little water is first to be poured
in, and then four or five seeds, after which each hole is to be covered with a mixture
of soil and manure, and firmly trodden down with the foot. In the other
methods a roller is to be used."
</p><p>
The next process is weeding, loosening, and breaking fine the earth.&mdash;He then
observes, "After the plants have attained some degree of strength and size, the most
advanced and perfect plant should be selected and all the rest rooted out, for if two
or more be suffered to rise together, they will increase in height without giving lateral
shoots; the leaves will be large and luxuriant, but the pods will be few." He
next proceeds to the pruning of the plants to make them bear copiously&mdash;gathering
the pods&mdash;preparing and spinning the wool&mdash;weaving the cloth.&mdash;This abridged account
I have given to shew, that they are not deficient in writings of this kind.</p></div>

from the maps that were constructed by a very laborious and, as far as we had an
opportunity of comparing them with the country, a very accurate survey, which
employed the Jesuits ten years. I do not pretend to say that the areas, as I have
given them in the table, are mathematically correct, but the dimensions were taken
with as much care as was deemed necessary for the purpose, from maps drawn on
a large scale, of which a very beautiful manuscript copy is now in his Majesty's library
at Buckingham-house, made by a Chinese, having all the names written in
Chinese and Tartar characters.</p></div>
